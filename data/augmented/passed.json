        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "through the whole lesson we have learned that some issues can zoom if two users or more air information at the same time.with these independent intervals the system cannot assure that there won't be collisions, overflow or congestion which might affect the correct arrival of the packets (there is a risk that the information won't be correctly sent) . but with the condition given on the lecture that this interval delta t is infinitely  small all of this problems will be avoided and there would not be any problem in the real net traffic.",

        "question": "what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose: to double the avoidance and find the “best” / shortest path with extending trees, easy to implement reverse path forward (rpf): each sender knows the network as a tree that extends itself. intermediate systems (es) should not know the trees that extend. once a package arrived at is two possible ways forward: (assuming that the transmission of the shortest route/ “best route”) * once a package arrived from the node to on the same link that the b node expects packets by its routing table, then this package will be sent to all other links except the incoming link. * once a package arrived from the node to another link as node b expect packages from to, then this package will be discarded. retransmission of the reverse route (rpb): it works as rpf but chooses specific links for outgoing traffic. resending packages one is e.g. m learns if it is located on the shortest route between two nodes (p. g. nod. is not a way forward).",

How is the table changed during the learning phase backwards? as mentioned in the conference, the bridges operate in promiscuo mode, so that the bridges see each frame sent into one of their lans. Looking at the original direction, they can tell which machine is accessible in which lan. 3. How is the table used in the rotation process? When a frame arrives at a bridge, the bridge must decide to abandon it or return it. Looking at the direction of destination of such a frame in a hash table stored on the bridge, you can decide to move away or redeploy it. The table can list each possible destination and tell which exit line belongs to that frame. Therefore, this frame will be transmitted. 4.

        "question": "what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "rpf and rpb are routing algorithms that use trees that cover, without each node having to know the whole tree. Inverse return: the basic principle is flooding, but not all incoming packets are sent again, but only those that have come from the shortest route. The shortest path is determined by recalling where (where it comes from) the packets that this sender usually comes from. Reverse retransflation: improvement in rpf not only by ignoring packages based on the incoming link, but also by putting packets back into the shortest outgoing connection. The shortest outgoing connection is the connection where the packets destined for the current source normally arrive.",
        "answer_feedback": "the stated purpose is not correct as the objective achieved by using a spanning tree i.e. avoiding loops/duplicates needs to be provided. the explanation for rpf and rpb is correct except that packets are also not forwarded to the node from which they were received.",

        "provided_answer": "a sweep tree is delineate as an undirected graph where every node in the network can be reached without having any routing loops. hence sweep trees are appealing for broad as well as multicasting due to the efficient transmission to the desired nodes in the network without having packets circling around (no routing loops). the link country routing protocol needs to be expanded by information on multicast groups of the intermediate systems (is). every is needs to know which multicast groups it belongs to but not (initially) how many other is are in the same group as well. all is periodically send link country packets that include the distance to their neighbours as well as the information of their multicast group via broadcast to all the other nodes on the network. finally each is can calculate a multicast tree as well as the outgoing lines on which packets have to be transmitted.",
        "answer_feedback": "the explanation behind using a spanning tree for multicast and broadcast is partially correct because though the network is loop-free, using the tree results in the minimum number of message copies required to be forwarded and not just the prevention of forwarding loops. the explanation for modifying the link-state algorithm to construct a  multicast spanning tree is correct.",

After that, when the amount of damped data is sufficient, the sequence reader stops from prefetching data then the packet arrivals will cease continuously until the player continues the prefetching process again.

        "provided_answer": "the fish process that is used to model packet arrivals is not very realistic for real Internet traffic. if packet arrivals are considered for a longer period (through day and night, or through before and after the black Friday period, ...), there will certainly be some intervals with a lot of sequels (on the 1st day or during the black Friday promotion) or a lot of sequels (on the 1st day or before and after the promotion). the other scenario could be possible when considering the arrivals of video transmission packages, with the help of the streaming buffer, the package will arrive continuously for a period of time (when the sequence player prefetches the data and stores them in his own buffer). After that, when the amount of damped data is sufficient, the sequence reader stops from prefetching data then the packet arrivals will cease continuously until the player continues the prefetching process again. Thus, the actual Internet traffic depends to a large extent on the hours of the day and the applications.",
        "answer_feedback": "one can use a function instead of a constant to model the arrival rate to reflect such large-scale behavioral patterns like having more traffic in the evening. the arrivals would not depend on previous arrivals then, only on the time of the day, which is known. apart from that, the response is correct.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the main purpose of both rearward path forwarding and rearward path broadcast is router initiating broadcast and to reduce copies of bundles in the network. for rearward path forwarding each sender has its own spanning tree but the is do not need to know the spanning tree hence each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-bundles. each is checks whether a bundle arrived at the is entry port over which the bundles for this station are usually sent. if so we can assume that the best route is used so far and we can continue charge over all edges except the incoming one. if not, discard the package. rearward path broadcast is like rearward path forwarding with specific selection of the outgoing links (instead of recharge over all edges). rearward path broadcast can learn by bundles failing to appear that it is not located on the unicast path and also learn by inspecting the unicast bundles that it is located on the unicast path from destination to sender which helps to get rid of even more copies in the network compared to rearward path forwarding.",

        "provided_answer": "the inverse path is a variation of the tree of the span. each sender has his tree of span won. so if a node revives something from one of his links, he checks the source address(example :a) and compares to his own table, if he would send something to one: wold i uses the same link for that? if that's the case, the node knows that this is the optimal link for this direction. →sumption package has used the best rout so far→resend to all the edges next to the incoming. if this is not the case →sumption package this is not the optimal route →discard the package because it is probably a useless duplicate.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",

        "reference_answer": "since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds",

        "reference_answer": "property: there is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. this means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nspanning tree with link state routing: each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other is belong to the groups. therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with prim or kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "it does not contain cycles and is the minimal tree that connects all nodes. so it is the most efficient way to potentially reach all systems in the network. in the sweep tree modification of contact state routing, each intermediate system uses the information from its neighbour to locally construct a multicast tree. this tree is eventually the same sweep tree for each node.",

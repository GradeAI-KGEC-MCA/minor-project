        "provided_answer": "both algorithms try to detect duplicate packets in broadcasts and only forward packets that are likely new and need to be forwarded. other packets are likely duplicates and are discarded.  in reverse path forwarding, each router saves which path a packet takes from a sender s in a unicast communication, considering it to be the shortest path from s. from there on, broadcast packets from s that are not coming over that path are considered to be duplicates and are discarded. broadcast packets from s coming over that path are accepted and broadcasted to all edges except to the incoming one. one disadvantage of rpf is that the packet is resent over all edges (except the incoming one), but not forwarded only over suitable edges.  in reverse path broadcast, a node also remembers the path taken from a sender s in a unicast communication. additionally, a node also learns that if it never received a unicast packet from s to another node b, then it is likely not on the shortest path from s to b. to reduce the unnecessary packet duplication in rpf, the packet is not forwarded on all edges (except the incoming edge), but only on the edges which are in the reversed direction to source s.",

        "provided_answer": "purpose: duplicate avoidance and find the “best” route / shortest path with spanning trees, easy to implement reverse path forwarding (rpf): each sender knows the network as spanning tree for itself. intermediate systems (is) must not know the spanning trees. once a packet arrived at a is there are two possible ways to forward: (assuming shortest path transmission/”best route”) * once a packet arrived from node a on the same link as node b expect packets by its routing table, then this packet will be forwarded to all other links except the incoming link. * once a packet arrived from node a on another link as node b expect packets from a, then this packet will be discarded. reverse path broadcast (rpb): works like rpf but chooses specific links for the outgoing traffic. by forwarding unicast packets an is e.g. m learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node s and d). if this is not the case and s is sending a broadcasting packet, m would not forward this packet towards d as it knows that it is not on the shortest path from s to d. if m has learned that it is on the shortest path, it will obviously forward a broadcast packet to the destination. depending on whether a certain path is used for unicast packets, an is will use it to forward broadcast packets or omits the packets. thus, the overall network throughput is reduced.",

        "provided_answer": "no, because the arrivals are dependent from each other in terms of network state. for example, if a link fails, the likelihood that the next packet will not arrive is high if the last sent packet also did not. reason for that is that in this case the link failure prevented the last packet from arriving and it is likely that the next packet will take the same route. hence, it probably would also be dropped at that failed link. same applies to full buffers of nodes lying on a route.",

        "provided_answer": "there are multiple ways how to detect duplicate packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented service.\none method is using only temporarily valid tsaps, which are only valid for one connection.by using this method, neither the endsystem (es) nor the sender has to  store additional information over a \"long\" timebit since this results in long length port numbers/ tsaps, with this method results in a higher bandwidth. additionally,  \"well known\" tsaps are present, making this method not suitable.\nanother method is to identify each connection by assigning a sequence number (seqno) to each connection individually, while the es remembers already assigned seqno.this allows the use of \"well known\" tsaps while allowing detection of delayed duplicate packets. compared to the text method, this way you have a lower bandwidth need in exchange for a higher memory need, since the es needs store this information, but this information needs to be available, whenever needed. additionally, this method does not support connections-less systems.\nthe last method is that each physical data unit (pdu) has an individual seqno.this way, es do not need to store additional information for a longer time and \"well known\" tsaps can be used.furthermore, the seqno for pdus would last for a long time, even assuming they aren't reset. this can further improved by limiting reissuing seqnos and limiting the packet lifetime.however, this results in an higher usage of bandwidth and memory.",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding (rpf) and reverse path broadcast (rpb) is to guarantee the most efficient way to forward information from any sender to any receiver terminal, thus providing the best possible loop-free spanning tree for each sender terminal. by using the most efficient way rpf and rpb reduce the number of packets needed for broadcasting. in rpf each router must have information which path it would use for unicast-packets. when a packet arrives at the is entry, it will be asked whether packets are normally also sent over this station for this source. if yes, then the packet will use the best route so far and will be resent over all edges (except the income one). if not, the packet does not use the best route and is discarded. therefore, the most efficient way is then established, but rpf always requires a resend over all edges, which costs a lot of bandwidth capacity.     in rpb is no resend over all edges. when the packet arrives at the is entry, it will be asked whether the packets are normally also sent over this station for this specific source. if yes the edge will be selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to the specific source (in reversed direction). if not, the packet gets discarded.",

        "reference_answer": "since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the main purpose of both reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is router initiating broadcast and to reduce copies of packets in the network. for reverse path forwarding each sender has its own spanning tree but the is do not need to know the spanning tree hence each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. each is checks whether a packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent. if so we can assume that the best route is used so far and we can continue sending over all edges except the incoming one. if not, discard the package. reverse path broadcast is like reverse path forwarding with specific selection of the outgoing links (instead of resending over all edges). reverse path broadcast can learn by packets failing to appear that it is not located on the unicast path and also learn by inspecting the unicast packets that it is located on the unicast path from destination to sender which helps to get rid of even more copies in the network compared to reverse path forwarding.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. they enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. if this is the case, no forwarding takes place to avoid loops. reverse path forwarding (also called reverse path flooding) (rpf) is a variation of the method spanning tree. each sender has its spanning tree. the other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. the assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  the rpf algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. if yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. if not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. this duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. the significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. if a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. as soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. the disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. the reverse path broadcast (rpb) is like rpf but with a specific selection of outgoing links. after the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. if yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s. if not, it won't send over all edges. reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding: if a node receives a packet which it should forward further, it determines, if the packet sender is in the direction of the incoming packet. if yes, the packet is on the best route and is sent via all other edges except the incoming. otherwise, it's ignored, because it's moste likely a duplicate. reverse path broadcast behaves similar in selecting if the packet should be forwarded. but, instead of sending it to all other nodes, it does not forward the packets to another node, if it knows that it is not on the best route for this given source and destination.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "for real internet traffic, the assumption of independent arrivals for each time unit does not hold truth, as there are packets in sequence that belong to each other and make the arrival of more packets of the same type more probable (bursty traffic). a good example for this dependent arrival of packets is streaming a movie - there is a sequence of similar packets arriving until the receiving buffer is full, so we cannot speak about indepedent arrival of the packets.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "it can’t always hold for real internet traffic, because receiver accepts a packet or not  depends on the data packet transmission protocol. for example, the protocol requires that packets need to be received in a certain order, at this time, the time interval is not independent.",

        "reference_answer": "1.a mapping between destinations/stations (macs) and outgoing lan interfaces.\n2.this table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. when a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its lan links) with source address q on lan l, it adds the timestamped entry “q can be reached over l” to the table and the next time a packet with destination q arrives, it is forwarded on link l. the time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic.\n3.to do selective forwarding instead of flooding. \n4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented.\nii)less congestion.\niii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.",
        "provided_answer": "table holds information about stations and associated lans over which these stations could be reached through the bridge.\nin backwards learning phase, the bridge works in promiscuous mode, meaning that it receives any frame on any of its lans, so when bridge receives frames with source address q on lan l, this would mean that station q can be reached over lan l. therefore now we create table entry according to this learned information.\nhow is the table used in the forwarding process: by generation of spanning trees with lans as edges and bridges as nodes. the bridge are actually identified by unique identifiers (such as serial number or mac address) and then all the bridges are supposed to broadcast their unique id, from which lowest id is chosen as root for all other bridges. \nbenefit is that loops can be avoided and this increases reliability as we are able to connect lans via various bridges in parallel.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "broadcast routing with individual sending to every destination is bad because of waste of bandwidth and the sender has to know all destinations. also, flooding is not good because too many duplicates will exist. that's why reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is used. reverse path forwarding has the following algorithm implemented: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - yes: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) - no: discard the packet (most likely duplicate) reverse path broadcast has the following algorithm implemented: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - yes: packet used the best route until now?           - yes: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s (in reversed direction) ﻿﻿          - no: do not send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in reverse path forwarding (rpf) - no: discard the packet (most likely duplicate)",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. in reverse path forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. an accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. if packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. reverse path broadcasting makes use of the reverse path forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. if they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. by doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",

        "provided_answer": "we learned about reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. reverse path forwarding / reverse path flooding: the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. the spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. there can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to s? - if it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. reverse path broadcast the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. it basically works as reverse path forwarding with one difference: when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. a node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",

        "reference_answer": "1.a mapping between destinations/stations (macs) and outgoing lan interfaces.\n2.this table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. when a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its lan links) with source address q on lan l, it adds the timestamped entry “q can be reached over l” to the table and the next time a packet with destination q arrives, it is forwarded on link l. the time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic.\n3.to do selective forwarding instead of flooding. \n4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented.\nii)less congestion.\niii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.",
        "provided_answer": "the table consists of multiple entries. when a bridge receives a frame from source q on lan l (for the first time) then it adds an entry to it’s table consisting of q, l and a timestamp. this entry indicates that q is reachable via l. the timestamp is used to purge old entries and adapt to changes in the topology. a timestamp of an entry is updated whenever a new frame is received from the same sourcenode.\nif the bridge then receives a frame from a different lan with the destination q, it looks up in the table and finds that q is reachable via l and forwards it to l.\nif the source and destination lans of a frame are the same, the bridge drops the packet and if it has no entry for a destination it floods it.\nthis reduces the amount of floodings which are very resource-consuming.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic. real internet traffic has built in congestion and flow control mechanisms, therefore if the packets get dropped due to queue buffer overflow from high arrival rate, there would be missing ack messages detected at the sender side. therefore the rate of transmission from sender will drop or slow down to compensate for slow receiver. in this sense the arrivals at each time interval are not really independent.",

        "provided_answer": "spanning trees avoid loops in the subnets which make them pretty useful for multicast, as the spanning tree already mitigates any loops in the multicast forwarding. to work with link state routing, the link state packets have to be broadcasted to all other nodes to be able to calculate a spanning tree on each node separately. the distance information are updated periodically with the distances to the neighbors by the other is.",

        "question": "assume you have a local network with 3 users that are all interconnected and have perfect clocks. typically the network is often congested as all users generate more traffic than the link’s capacities. which of the encoding techniques introduced in the lecture should be used in this network to encode bitstreams? give two reasons for your answer in 2-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "binary encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",
        "provided_answer": "differential manchester encoding is the best option because of its good self-clocking feature which is important in a congested network. it also provides error detection.",
        "answer_feedback": "the binary encoding is the better option because of better bandwidth utilization and no self-clocking requirement.",

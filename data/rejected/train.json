        "provided_answer": "there are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * hidden terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. as an example, we can imagine that station a and c does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station b in the middle. so a and c both try to transmit data to c, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * exposed terminals: a problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. we can easily imagine a situation, where the stations b and c are in close proximity to each other, but where c cannot see b’s partner a and b cannot detect c’s partner d.  if b wants to send data to a, which is not visible to c, c has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner d is also blocked by b’s communication. in reality, c could send parallel to b, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. so we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * inherent heterogenity: as mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * dynamic source routing: due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. so one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based dynamic source routing in reactive routing protocols.",

        "provided_answer": "mobile routing has different challenges, since communication does not happen on a wired medium and is therefore broadcast by nature.  1. hidden terminals: if two nodes, a and c, can't hear each other due to their distance, and there is a node b located in the intersection of their transmission, their transmissions can collide at node b without a and c noticing it. csma/cd does not work here, since a and c will not hear each other and can therefore not detect a collision.   2. exposed terminal problem: station b transmits to station a at the same time c wants to transmit to d. if c senses the medium. it will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to d, but it’s unnecessary because these two transmissions don’t interfere each other. this leads to an underutilization of the channel.",

        "provided_answer": "security: since listening to wireless communication does not require a physical presence within the building, a new focus has to be drawn to securing the network protocols against for example man-in-the-middle attacks. error detection and correction: errors in wireless communication are harder to detect and correct as the geologic topology of the network can change rapidly. while we can detect jams in ethernet pretty reliably this challenge becomes hard when clients move during data transfer",

        "provided_answer": "hidden terminals: in mobile communication, one challenge is, that several nodes cant hear each other. therefore if two nodes that can't hear each other communicate with a third node both can reach a collision at this third node can occur. further, the first two nodes cannot sense the collision and thus the communication is very unreliable, in addition to the waste of resources that always comes with collisions. this problem can be avoided if the third node sends a \"busy tone\" to the first two nodes if it receives data by one of those nodes and therefore the other one keeps silent. however, a separate channel for the busy tones is needed. exposed terminals: example with the four terminals: a b c d. each terminal reaches only its neighbours. if b sends data to a and c wants to send data to d, c can sense the transmission of b and a and therefore has to wait, even though a is outside the range of c and therefore a collision would not occur. this leads to underutilisation of the channel and therefore a lower effective throughput.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "1. hidden terminals: in mobile routing we communicate wireless. consider the setup from slide 11: a to b, c to b. in here, node a can communicate with the intermediate node b but not with node c. node c can communicate with the intermediate node b but not with node a. the hidden terminal problem occurs when node a and node b want to send data to node b at the same time. this results in collsions and waste of resources. the collision problem can be solved with request-to-send (rts) and clear-to-send (cts) mechanism. when node a wants to send something to node b, node a first asks whether the communication channel is available through rts. if everything is ok, b sends a cts message to a and c. as a consequence, node c knows that nothing can be sent to b for a certain amount of time. if node c wants to send something to b, c needs to reserve the channel too by a rts. 2. near and far terminals: - consider the setup from slide 18: we have three nodes a, b and c. b and c are relatively close to each other while a has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. the problem of near and far terminals occurs when a and b want to send something to c at the same time. due to the fact that the signal strength decreases the larger the distance is, the signal of b drowns out the weaker signal of a. as a consequence, c cannot receive anything from a.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "1. hidden terminals every node has its transmission range. in hidden terminals problem, there are three nodes a, b and c. nodes a and c cannot hear each other due to the limited range. when they both want to transmit packages to b, the tranmissions can collide at node b. in this case, nodes a and c are hidden from each other, which could cause more collisions in the channel. 2. exposed terminals there are now four nodes a, b, c and d. b sends to a and c wants to send to d, which will not receive anything from a. but c has to wait, because it signals that a medium is in use. however, a is outside the range of c, therefore there is no need to wait. in this case, c is exposed to b, which could lead to underutilization of channel.",

        "provided_answer": "security challenges occur, because a mobile network may reach outside a building and can be seen from adversaries easily. this is not a challenge compared to wired networks, where cables end at end nodes and certain packets from the intranet can be dropped automatically. another challenge is the hidden terminal problem: this occurs in networks, where some outer nodes want to send something to an inner node in between them, but they both don't see each other. therefore, if they both would start transmitting to the inner node, collisions would occur at the inner node.",

        "reference_answer": "slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nin the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. this results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each round trip time (rtt). this is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. when cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\ncongestion avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nin the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. there are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. this is done until a packet is lost. typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1.",
        "provided_answer": "the first phase is called slow start, where we quickly want to discover the correct sending rate. each time a segment is acknowledged, cwnd is increased, leading to an exponential growth until the cwnd reaches ss_thresh. then we get to the congestion avoidance phase, where we do an additive increase gradually probing for additional bandwidth. upon timeout, we do a multiplicative decrease, setting ss_thresh to be 50% of the current size of the congestion window and then set cwnd to 1 and reenter the slow start phase.",
        "answer_feedback": "the explanation of the slow start phase is partially correct as it neither mentions the event when a packet is lost before ss_thresh is reached nor provides details of the changes to ss_thresh and the congestion window. additionally, it does not mention by what factor cwnd is increased when a segment is acknowledged, i.e. by 1.",

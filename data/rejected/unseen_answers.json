        "provided_answer": "adaptation of routing protocols due to the inherent variability of a mobile network: the packets must be routed despite convergence problems due to frequent changes in topology and environment due to mobile nodes, i.e. frequent routing table updates, unreliable/unavailable links due to receiving/transmitting problems (near and far terminals, energy saving, insufficient transmission power), so the path from source to destination is much more short-lived or subject to changes much more often than in fixed networks. * addressing (auto-configuration): the automatic configuration of the end systems is difficult due to roaming and this obviously also affects routing. when roaming at layer 2, the ip address can be retained, but the packet must be routed via an appropriate access point: if there is a handover, the old ap would have to forward the packets to the new one; when roaming at layer 3, a subnet change may result in the assignment of a new ip address.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "csma/cd does not work for wireless transmission. main issue is the broadcast nature of mobile transmission. * hidden terminal problem: firstly, carrier sense fails because a station that want to send cannot “see” another station already  sending to its destination as it is not in the transmission range of the other sending station. secondly, there is no collision detection after the collision arised. this leads to a higher amount of collisions, a wastage of resources and unreliability. for example: * station a sends to station b; station c is not in the range of a, thus, does not receive a’s signal * c performs carrier sensing as it wants to send to b, senses a free medium * c sends to b which causes collision at b; a cannot detect the collision (as it is a wireless scenario) * station a and c are hidden from each other\n\t * exposed terminal problem: the “exposed” station is waiting to transmit a signal, as it hears a signal from another transmitting station. thus, it tries to prevent a collision which actually will not occur as the receiver of the other sending station is outside of its range. this leads to underutilization of the channel and a decreased effective throughput. for example: * station b sends to station a; station c wants to send to another station outside of b’s transmission range * c performs carrier sensing and senses a busy medium, thus it has to wait * a is outside of c’s transmission range, thus, c actually does not need to wait as it would not cause a collision at a; c is exposed to b",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "two of the many challenges of mobile routing compared to fixed / wired networks are hidden terminals and security issues. hidden terminal can occur, when the nodes are quite far apart, while some nodes are not able to detect nodes anymore, while more centered nodes are able to detect messages from both the distant nodes. then the distant nodes are not able to detect collisions occuring in the „middle“ of the network at the centered nodes, because the signal is not transmitted over all network nodes. one of the security issues can be, that wifi is set up inside of a building. a normal ethernet network over cable would connect all the nodes inside, and then can be configured to discard all the internal packages at the outgoing router to the internet. a wifi network cannot be configured, to only nodes inside of the building are able to receive the packages. if the network is available outside of the building, then any node outside will be able to detect the network.",

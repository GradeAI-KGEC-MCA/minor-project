Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

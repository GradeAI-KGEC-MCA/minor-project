        "provided_answer": "1. larger address space \n- IPv4 only allows to specify IP addresses of 32 bit (4 bytes) in the following format:\na.b.c.d whereby a,b,c,d in [0-255]\nwhich results in 4.294.967.296 possible different addresses according to wikipedia which is not sufficient anymore\n- IPv6 allows to specify IP addresses of 128 Bit length  (16 bytes) and does not solely include numbers. As a consequence,\nIPv6 allows to support billion of end-systems due to larger address space (according to wikipedia 2^128 different ip addresses possible)\n\n2. increase of security\n- the protocol IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) allows to achieve the security goals confidentiality, authenticity and integrity on the network level. For instance, this can prevent the manipulation of the IP source address or the content of the IP datagram (integrity protection).\n- IPSec is supported by IPv6 by default\n\n3. simplify protocol processing\n- due to a simplified IP header in IPv6 the protocol processing becomes less complex for routers. In general one can say that the header of an IPv6 packet has less fields to process, e.g. the header checksum is removed (can be handled on layer 2 or layer 4). This results in a speed up processing time at routers.\n\n4. increase routing efficiency\n- IPv6 requires less hops\n- IPv6 does not evaluate the checksum on IP level",

        "provided_answer": "Three common techniques to address the issue of redundant packages in the transport layer in a connection-oriented environment are as follows. First, we can implement a method based on the sum of checks. Each package is assigned a unique check sum value, which is verified at the receiving end. If the sum of checks in the received package matches the amount sent, the package is considered valid, and if not, discarded. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, since it does not require any additional information storage or complex processing. However, the disadvantage is that it does not actually eliminate redundant packages but simply filters them into the receiver. Second, we can employ a time-based method. This implies adding a time mark to each package and rejecting any package that arrives too late compared to the expected arrival time based on the negotiated data transfer rate of the connection.

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "A useful property for broad-/multicasting of the spanning tree for a certain node is that it does not only specify the optimal path from the other nodes to this node, but also the optimal paths from this node to the other nodes. Link State Routing can be used to construct multicast spanning trees by first running the Link State Routing procedure to get the spanning tree for a certain node X. This spanning tree could already be used as the multicast spanning tree for node X, but it can be optimized by removing all edges that are not part of any path between any two nodes of the multicast group.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"The advantage of employing a broad-/multicast spanning tree for a specific node is that it not only reveals the most efficient route for communication from other nodes to that node, but also uncovers the most effective routes for communication from that node to the other nodes. By implementing Link State Routing, multicast spanning trees can be constructed for a given node X. However, even though the resulting tree may be utilized as the multicast tree for node X, it can still be refined by deleting any edges that do not contribute to the connection between any two nodes within the multicast group.",

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

The average number of packets, N, in the system can be calculated by dividing the utilization by one minus the utilization: N = 0.9 / (1 - 0.9) = 9 packets.

This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.",
        "provided_answer": "The TCP congestion control consists of two primary stages: overflow and underflow. During the overflow phase, the Congestion Window (cwnd) shrinks significantly when a packet is lost due to network congestion, while the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) remains constant. Once cwnd reaches half the value of ss_thresh, the underflow phase commences. During this stage, the cwnd expands slowly, as each acknowledged packet permits an increment, and ss_thresh decreases proportionally. This oscillation between the overflow and underflow phases ensures stable network flow.\n\nDespite the incorrect labeling of the phases, this student answer attempts to describe the basic behavior of TCP congestion control and the roles of cwnd and ss_thresh. However, the student's description of the phases being labeled as overflow and underflow instead of slow start and congestion avoidance is factually incorrect",

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "While it is true that packet arrivals in real internet traffic do not follow a perfect Poisson distribution, the assumption of independence for arrivals within a given time interval is still valid. The bursts in traffic are due to various factors such as congestion control, user behavior, or application requirements. However, the occurrence of one arrival does not directly impact the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For instance, a congested network might cause a delay in packet transmission, but it does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval. Therefore, while the arrivals might not be Poisson distributed, they can still be considered independent within each time interval.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Although real-world internet traffic packet arrivals deviate from the perfect Poisson distribution, the assumption of independence among arrivals within a specified time frame remains intact. Traffic bursts result from various influences, including congestion control, user activity, and application demands. Yet, the occurrence of a single arrival does not modify the likelihood of another arrival in the same time frame. For example, a network experiencing congestion may trigger packet delays, but it does not automatically increase the number of arrivals within that time frame. Consequently, while the packet arrivals may not conform to a Poisson distribution, they can nevertheless be regarded as independent within each time interval.",

        "provided_answer": "In this network scenario, given that the users have perfect clocks, it would be best to use Run-Length Encoding (RLE). First, RLE can effectively compress repeated bit sequences, which could be prevalent in the traffic generated by the users. Second, RLE can simplify the decoding process for the users as they only need to store and transmit the number of consecutive identical bits, reducing the overall data size and, subsequently, network load. However, it's important to note that RLE might not be the most efficient in terms of bandwidth as it doesn't achieve a full bit per baud. Nevertheless, the reduction in overall data size and network load could still be a valuable advantage.\"\n\nRephrased answer: With users possessing precise timepieces in this network environment, employing Run-Length Encoding (RLE) would be advantageous. Primarily, RLE excels at compressing frequent bit sequences, which are likely to emerge in user-generated traffic. Secondly, RLE simplifies decoding for users as they merely transmit and save the number of recurring identical bits. This strategy decreases the total data size and, consequently, the network's burden. Although RLE may not lead to optimal bandwidth utilization, the significant reduction in data size and network load could remain beneficial.",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "A spanning tree can optimize routes through a network while avoiding loops. The property of what has to be optimized can be varied. For instance: distance, traffic, fewest hops etc. For broad- and multicasting this is very appealing as it is possible to optimize a tree to minimize copies sent through the network.  In Multicasting a group of nodes are connected into small groups. The goal for multicasting is to find a spanning tree connecting the routers of a local multicast group. This can we one specific tree, such as in \"shared tree\" or sender specific spannign trees, such as in the \"Source-based trees\".  The link state Routing procedure already builds up spanning trees to use for unicasting. During the distribution of the information that every IS has gathered about its neighbors (phase 4), the information is expanded by the information on the multicast groups.

        "provided_answer": "REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing. Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The principle of RPF is each sender has its own Spanning Tree but IS does not need to know the Spanning Trees. Each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Algorithm of RPF is as below: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. TRPB routing is an extension of RPB routing. It ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. The principle of RPB is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. A router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. The Algorithm of RPB is as below: Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent?  YES: Packet used the BEST route until now?   YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction)  NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)  NO: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "Spanning Trees, which form a subset of all subnets including all routers have the main posivite property that they do not include any loops. So transmission along a spanning tree is also loop-free and therefore more efficient than a \u201cwild\u201d transmission in all direction for all nodes (flooding).  To implement a spanning tree in Link State Routing, all nodes have to know the common spanning tree. To achieve this, all nodes send link state packets periodically, which include information about the distance to its neighbours as well as multicast-group information. Those packets are broadcasted to all nodes. Then, all nodes can calculate (and later improve) the multicast tree with the completed state information, which then determines the outgoing lines for further transmission.",

Also, with CSMA/CD it is easier to add new users/stations (connect stations without shutting down the network). (I think, one could also choose p-persistent CSMA with small p, since the performances of p-persistent with small p and non-persistent are very similar at high load (slide 29) and p-persistent is a compromise between delay and throughput.)\nHowever, the disadvantage of CSMA/CD is that the number of collisions increases as the utilization increases, and there is poor throughput during high utilization periods.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

CSMA/CD requires more complex hardware and higher power consumption compared to other MAC procedures, which could result in higher upfront costs and ongoing energy expenses. Additionally, while CSMA/CD can handle high channel loads, its performance may suffer in environments with a large number of devices contending for the channel, leading to longer waiting times and potentially decreased throughput.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Considering the company's specifications, I propose adopting the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Media Access Control (MAC) technique.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The main purpose of both Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is router initiating broadcast and to reduce copies of packets in the network. For Reverse Path Forwarding each sender has its own Spanning Tree but the IS do not need to know the spanning tree hence each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Each IS checks whether a packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent. If so we can assume that the best route is used so far and we can continue sending over all edges except the incoming one. If not, discard the package. Reverse Path Broadcast is like Reverse Path Forwarding with specific selection of the outgoing links (instead of resending over all edges). Reverse Path Broadcast can learn by packets failing to appear that it is not located on the unicast path and also learn by inspecting the unicast packets that it is located on the unicast path from destination to sender which helps to get rid of even more copies in the network compared to Reverse Path Forwarding.",

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS.

If there is a node B in between which can communicate with both of them, this node can detect these collisions. CSMA/CD does not work in this case.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

So this way  the P changing from State of P0 till P10.

So we need to check for the \u201cBlocking Probability\u201d and \u201cExpected Number of Customers in the System\u201d in order to determine the number of seconds the queue is not full or less than 10 packets in the waiting queue.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The calculation of the probability set for the number of packets in the queue must be carried out for every new state of packet arrival and packet processing within a 1-minute interval. As the arrival rate increases, the queue becomes progressively more congested until it reaches the threshold of N = 10, at which point packet drops occur and the arrival rate decreases. Thus, the probability P transitions from P0 to P10. Conversely, when the arrival rate decreases, more packets are processed from the queue and the queue size shrinks from P10 until the arrival rate increases once more. To determine the number of seconds during which the queue has fewer than 10 packets in it or is not completely full, we must examine the \"Blocking Probability\" and \"Average Number of Customers in the System.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

The probability that you get another packet after you received one is much higher as e.g. video applications might fetch the next seconds of the video into the local buffer which causes a number of packets.

Moreover, IPv6 simplified protocol processing with a more complicated header structure. This made it easier for developers to write code, as they did not have to worry about the complexities of IPv4 headers. Finally, IPv6 did not prioritize security at all, as it was believed that security could be added later through additional protocols. However, it turns out that the lack of built-in IPv6 devices made IPv6 a prime target for hackers, and security became an important goal after deployment.\" Reformed response: The main intent behind IPv6 development was to facilitate the connection of a limited number of devices at any time given that the creation of a security environment could be directed to IPv as a more advanced security issue.",

An advantage of this method is that it is relatively simple to implement, as it only requires a clock and some memory to store the time stamps. However, a disadvantage is that it may lead to increased processing overhead due to the need to maintain and compare time stamps for each packet.\n\nSecond, there is the Checksum Approach.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

Link State Routing can be used to construct multicast spanning trees by first running the Link State Routing procedure to get the spanning tree for a certain node X.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "No, this assumption does not hold in the real internet traffic. In the real internet traffic packets arrive in bursts and over longer time periods there are phases with more or with less traffic.

        "provided_answer": "The first reason is that this technique efficiently represents repeated sequences of bits, which is common in network traffic and can help reduce transmission time in general. Secondly, despite inaccurate clocks, Run Long Encoding is less sensitive to the drift of the clock compared to other coding techniques, since it is based on the number of consecutive zeros or some, not on their exact time. This makes it more resistant to clock discrepancies and therefore an appropriate choice for this network scenario. Reformulated answer: \"Considering a network with three interconnected nodes, each with inaccurate clocks, it is recommended to use Run Long Encoding as a method of coding. First and foremost, Run Long Encoding effectively encodes and decodes repeated sequences of data, which often occur in network traffic. Therefore, it can significantly decrease the time of data transmission in general. In addition, this technique of coding is less affected by the drift of the clock compared to other methods of coding due to its dependence in number of consecutive zeros or in place of schedule.",

IPv6 was designed to address the problem of limited IP addresses by increasing the address length from 32 bits to 128 bits. This allows for an exponentially higher number of addresses, allowing better Internet connectivity for more devices. In addition, IPv6 strives to improve Internet performance by simplifying the header structure and reducing the overall costs associated with routing. These improvements lead to faster data transfer and more efficient use of network resources. Despite the importance of these objectives, it is important to note that IPv6 is not exempt from challenges. For example, increasing the length of the address can lead to compatibility problems with older systems and protocols. Therefore, it is crucial that\" it is said again: \"The key objectives of IPv6 include improving the performance of the Internet and improving the performance of IP systems through approximation.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

In here, node A can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node C. Node C can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node A. The hidden terminal problem occurs when node A and node B want to send data to node B at the same time. This results in collsions and waste of resources. The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C. As a consequence, node C knows that nothing can be sent to B for a certain amount of time. If node C wants to send something to B, C needs to reserve the channel too by a RTS. 2. Near and Far Terminals: - Consider the setup from slide 18: We have three nodes A, B and C. B and C are relatively close to each other while A has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. The problem of near and far terminals occurs when A and B want to send something to C at the same time.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

Currently, they would like to have 20 systems sharing the channel, but it should be expandable later on. Which of the MAC procedures introduced in the lecture (Polling, TDMA with or without Reservation, Token Ring, Pure or Slotted ALOHA, 1-persistent CSMA, p-persistent CSMA, non-persistent CSMA or CSMA/CD) would you recommend?Give 2 reasons for your decision and 1 potential weakness of your recommendation in 2-6 sentences.",

        "provided_answer": "Based on the company's requirement for high channel load and expandability, I would recommend CSMA/CD as the MAC procedure. The primary reason for this recommendation is CSMA/CD's ability to handle high traffic efficiently due to its collision detection feature. This feature allows devices to quickly detect and recover from data collisions, ensuring that data transmission continues without significant delay.\n\nSecondly, CSMA/CD is a popular and well-established MAC procedure, making it a cost-effective choice for the company. It is widely used and has extensive hardware support, making it a compatible and practical option for most network infrastructures.\n\nHowever, a potential weakness of CSMA/CD is its susceptibility to collisions, especially in high-traffic environments. This could result in increased waiting times for devices, leading to decreased overall network performance. In contrast, other MAC procedures like TDMA with reservation or token ring may offer more predictable waiting",

UDP does not give any information about the right sequence of packages, so there is no guarantee for the order that the receiver gets or can create.\n- Furthermore, TCP gives reliability to the users by also including a field for acknowledgements in the header. To be more precise, the included sequence number works as an acknowledgement for a package receiver earlier. On the other hand, UDP does not give any guarantee concerning reliability of service, so there is no space in the header for any kind of acknowledgement. \n- What is more, TCP includes possibilities for flow and congestion control by dynamically adjusting the window size for sending and receiving packets at the same time. This process makes use of the \u201cAdvertised window\u201d field in the header which can be used by a receiver to transmit its optimal window size for reception of packets. UDP on the other hand does not include such features, so there is no space for windowing in the header. \n- Finally, TCP also gives the user possibilities to prioritize packages for urgent processing at the receiver process. Therefore, the header includes the so called 16-bit \u201cUrgent Pointer\u201d which is an offset to the sequence number and marks the last octet of a sequence of highly prioritized packets.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "To modify Link State Routing for multicasting, each intermediate system would share multicast group membership in its link status packages. However, it is important to keep in mind that building multicast trees using extending trees is not always feasible due to different requirements.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) are used in networks with broadcasting ability to find the best paths between senders/receivers. They work by flooding the network with packets. The intermediate stations will receive the packets and broadcast them to every node attached to them, except to the node where it came from. To accomplish the best path, the IS keeps track of where incoming packets were routed and if the packet has taken the best route.

This recorded information is then utilized in the forwarding phase to ensure that data is transmitted to the correct destination via the most optimal path. For instance, if a device is located on a network segment connected to the bridge via interface A, and a data packet destined for that device is received on interface B, the bridge will add an entry to its database indicating that device X can be reached via interface B.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "No, it does not hold. In real internet traffic, packet arrivals happen in bursts (or batches), the inter batch times are independent and exponentially distributed, and the batch sizes are random. The arriving packets are not independent and there is a high chance of receiving the following packets after receiving one. For instance, in torrent applications for file-sharing or web conferencing, the received packets should be related to the previous once.",

        "provided_answer": "The main difference between asynchronous and synchronous data transmission modes lies in the use or non-use of clock signals. Unlike the synchronous transmission that depends on clock signals to maintain synchronization, the asynchronous transmission operates without the need for such signals. Furthermore, in the asynchronous transmission, each character is encoded as a separate entity, while in the synchronous transmission, several characters are grouped as a continuous bit stream. It is important to bear in mind that the slower transmission rates in the asynchronous transmission are mainly attributed to the need to add start and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission can provide faster data speeds by compressing multiple bits in a single frame. Contrary to a widely maintained view, the use of flags to distinguish frames in the synchronous transmission does not intrinsically add complexity.

Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information  (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)",
        "provided_answer": "The dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) is a crucial network protocol that manages the allocation of IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a local area network (LAN). Although DHCP shares some similarities with RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol), it is more sophisticated and flexible. An important use of DHCP is the simplification of network configuration, especially in large organizations where manual allocation of IP addresses would take time and prone to errors. However, the main objective of DHCP is to replace the less efficient and less secure Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). Thus, while the reference response indicates that DHCP can provide additional configuration information, my response incorrectly indicates that its main objective is to replace BOOTP.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The main function of the network is to ensure that all nodes of a network are informed of the presence of other nodes and their state of connectivity. This is achieved by spreading inverse pointers across the network, allowing each node to maintain an updated inverted mapping of its neighbors. Inverse route forwarding: When a node receives a package from a neighbor, it checks its routing table to determine the best way back to the source of the package. It then forwards the package along all outgoing links except the one that received the package, ensuring that each link is crossed once. Inverse route forwarding: This mechanism is based on nodes that actively listen to and record unicat traffic as it passes through them. Keeping a record of which routes are used by unicat traffic, each node can determine which trees are part of it. Reformulated response: The nodes in a network employ inverse route deviation and reverse transmission of the transmission to stay aware of other nodes and their connections.",

        "question": "WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they ensure all nodes are connected while minimizing the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet forwarding.\n\nHowever, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to construct a spanning tree tailored for multicast groups. The key difference is that each node must be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link state packet, enabling each node to construct multicast trees once the network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the entire network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission, enabling packets to be forwarded only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and enhancing overall network performance.\"\n\nRephrased answer: Spanning trees are an allure for both broadcasting and multicasting due to their ability to link all nodes while minimizing the hop count. This is accomplished by establishing a loop-free subnet, thereby eliminating superfluous packet relaying.\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to multicasting, it is necessary to adapt Link State Routing (LSR) to fashion a spanning tree suited for multicast groups. The essential variation lies in the fact that every node must grasp which multicast clusters it is a part of, along with the identities of other nodes that are members of these clusters. Such details are encapsulated in the link state advertisement, empowering each node to generate multicast trees once the multicast group memberships and network topology have been disseminated across the entire network. Consequently, LSR enables economical multicast propagation, allowing packets to be transmitted",

        "reference_answer": "Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nMain advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except \u201cHop-by-Hop Extension\u201d) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.",
        "provided_answer": "Extension headers in IPv6 serve the same purpose as options in IPv4 but are located after the transport layer header instead of before. The main advantage of this arrangement is that it prevents fragmentation of packets during transmission. With extension headers placed after the transport layer header, intermediate devices can check the packet size against the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and fragment the packet only if necessary. This not only saves processing power but also reduces the likelihood of packet loss due to fragmentation.\n\nNote: This answer is incorrect because IPv6 extension headers are located before the transport layer header, not after it. The misplacement of the extension headers in this answer does not provide any actual advantage in terms of IPv6 design or functionality. Instead, it is a common misconception that may arise due to the unfamiliarity of some students with IPv6 header structure.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The position of extension headers in IPv6 packets differs from that in IPv4, being situated after the transport layer header instead of before. This alteration offers a significant benefit by averting packet fragmentation during transmission. Since extension headers come after the transport layer header, intermediary devices can assess the packet dimensions in relation to their maximum transmission unit (MTU) and break down the packet only if it surpasses the limit. This measure not only decreases the burden on processing power but also diminishes the probability of packet loss due to fragmentation.\n\nDespite the accuracy of the explanation regarding the advantages of this arrangement, it is essential to acknowledge that this answer contains an error. Extension headers in IPv6 are, in fact, situated before the transport layer header, not after it.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "An important characteristic of the Poisson distribution is that the probability of x taking a discrete value is independent upon the previous values i.e. the probability is independent of the past. Poisson distribution is often used to model arrival of packets during an interval. The packet arrival times modeled by the Poisson distribution have an exponential distribution and constitute an independent identically distributed process. However, in practice it has been shown that the packet inter-arrival times do not have an exponential distribution, hence the error introduced by modeling them as Poisson distribution is significantly large.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The independence of the Poisson distribution, which is a key feature, signifies that the likelihood of x assuming a specific discrete value doesn't hinge on the values that came before. This distribution is frequently utilized to depict the occurrence of data packets within a given interval. The packet arrival instants modeled via the Poisson distribution follow an exponential distribution, and they represent an independent and identically distributed (iid) process. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that packet inter-arrival instants do not conform to an exponential distribution, implying that the discrepancy resulting from modeling them as a Poisson distribution is substantial.",

You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",

        "provided_answer": "When it comes to duplicate packages in the transport layer of a connection-oriented service, three common methods can be used to mitigate this problem, each with its advantages and disadvantages. First, the use of checksums. Checksums provides a method to verify the integrity of the transmitted data. In the event that duplicate packages are detected, the recipient can rule out the one with the wrong sum. This method has the advantage of being simple and effective. However, it is based on the sender and the receiver to implement the checksum verification and may not be able to distinguish between duplicate packages sent intentionally or due to network errors. Second, selective recognition. In this method, the receiver sends a recognition for each packet received correctly, while discarding any duplicates. This method allows the recipient to request the retransmission of lost or damaged packages, instead of all packages as in the case of stopping and waiting.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "First, the mobility of nodes causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and cause data loss. This is because mobile nodes can easily interrupt the alignment of their antennas, causing their signals to crash. Second, due to the limitations inherent to battery power, mobile devices must conserve energy as much as possible. This requirement makes it essential to find energy efficient routing algorithms that reduce energy consumption while ensuring good connectivity and maintaining network integrity.\" Reformulated response: The complexities of mobile routing contrast sharply with those found in stable and wired networks.

        "question": "WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "Spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting because they eliminate all loops in the network, making the data transmission more efficient. To modify Link State Routing for multicasting, each intermediate system would share the multicast group membership in their link state packets. However, it's important to note that constructing multicast trees using spanning trees isn't always feasible due to the different requirements. While spanning trees ensure a single unique path between any two nodes in the tree, multicasting requires multiple copies of a packet to reach all members of the group, which could result in unnecessary redundancy and increased network traffic. Nonetheless, some multicast routing protocols like Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) do employ spanning trees as a part of their mechanism, but they also implement additional mechanisms to handle multicast traffic efficiently.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The allure of spanning trees lies in their ability to eliminate network loops, enhancing the efficiency of data transmission for both broadcasting and multicasting applications. To adapt Link State Routing to multicasting, intermediary devices would broadcast multicast group membership information in their link state packets. However, it's crucial to remember that constructing multicast trees using spanning trees isn't always a viable solution due to disparate requirements. Although spanning trees offer a distinct path between any pair of nodes, multicasting necessitates multiple instances of a packet to reach all members of the group, leading to potential redundancy and heightened network traffic. Nevertheless, certain multicast routing protocols, such as Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF), make use of spanning trees in conjunction with additional techniques to manage multicast traffic effectively.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The purpose is to allow broadcast without storing a much additional for every IS like a spanning tree or remember past packages while also reducing the amount of package copies. RPF When an IS receives a broadcast massage from sender S it only forwards it, if it comes from a station the IS would use to send unicast messages to S. This assumes that the IS has learned over time which next station is the best one to take, when sending to S and that this hold when a package goes the other way. If the broadcast message is received from an other station the IS assumes this is a douplicate. RPB Refines RPF by not broadcasting to all available stations once a message has been received over the right station. In RPB the IS learns which neighboring stations are on a good path to S and the message is send only to those. If for example station A has never received a message from B that goes to S than A does not send a broadcast message to B assuming that B gets its message from another \u201cbetter\u201c route.",

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The main function of Reverse Route Forwarding and Reverse Route Broadcasting is to ensure that all nodes of a network are kept informed of the presence of other nodes and their state of connectivity. This is achieved by spreading reverse pointers throughout the network, allowing each node to maintain an updated reverse mapping of its neighbors. Reverse Route Forwarding: When a node receives a package from a neighbor, check its routing table to determine the best route back to the package source. It then forwards the package along all the outgoing links except the one that received the package, making sure that each link is crossed once. Reverse Route Broadcasting: This mechanism is based on nodes that actively listen to and record unicast traffic as it passes through them.",

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "Spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting due to their property of creating a loop-free network. This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes through a unique path.\n\nHowever, constructing a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known to all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link state packet as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node must first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through some other means, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can construct a multicast spanning tree using algorithms like OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can handle the distribution of group membership information along with the network topology.\n\nMaximum Marks:",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "question": "WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The appealing property of a spanning tree formed from a network/graph is the fact that all nodes are MINIMALLY CONNECTED (i.e. no loops are included). If the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes. This means that the IS are not unnecessarily charged with messages during a Broad-/Multicast.  In order that all IS know the multicast trees, the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS. The row with destination and distance is expanded by the column indicating the multicast group membership of the destination. Since these packages are distributed to all nodes by broadcast, the IS can calculate the multicast tree for a certain multicast group independently once it has the information completely available locally to determine the outgoing lines for sending/forwarding the packages.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

Reverse Path Broadcast: All nodes inspect the sender and receiver of incoming packets and check if they have forwarded such messages in the past.

Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.",
        "provided_answer": "The TCP congestion control consists of two main stages: loss recovery and regression. At the loss recovery stage, the cwnd is increased rapidly to compensate for lost packages, while at the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid additional package losses. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with each recognition, leading to exponential growth. On the contrary, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half each time a package is lost. These adaptations help to balance network traffic and maintain a stable connection. However, it is important to note that these phases and their mechanisms are not explicitly called \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\" in the TCP protocol specification.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

This is accomplished by propagating reverse pointers throughout the network, allowing each node to maintain an up-to-date reverse mapping of its neighbors.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding: When a node receives a packet from a neighbor, it checks its routing table to determine the best path back to the packet's source. It then forwards the packet along all outgoing links except the one it received the packet on, ensuring that each link is traversed only once.\n\nReverse Path Broadcasting: This mechanism relies on nodes actively listening to and recording unicast traffic as it passes through them.

Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "In the data link layer, the primary distinction between asynchronous transmission modes and synchronous transmission modes is the presence or absence of clock signals. While the asynchronous transmission is not based on clock signals for synchronization, the synchronous transmission does. Furthermore, the asynchronous transmission encodes each character as an autonomous unit, while the synchronous transmission encodes multiple characters as a continuous bit stream. However, my understanding is that the asynchronous transmission usually results in lower transmission rates due to the addition of start and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission can achieve higher transmission rates through efficient multi-bit packaging in a single frame. Contrary to popular belief, the use of flag bits to define frames in synchronous transmission does not intrinsically increase complexity. Instead, the requirement for synchronic transmission synchronization between the sender and the receiver is the main source of complexity.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "No. In the real world, packet arrivals are rarely independent. It is very likely that data is split into multiple packets that are then sent and received in rapid succession. \n\nFurthermore, packets caused by humans will always share the dependencies of humans. For example if packets are sent because of human action, chances are that most humans in an area operate during roughly the same time frames. The majority will get up early, start their work, have a lunch break, finish work and go home. In this scenario, packet arrivals are not 100% independent, because they correlate with the productive hours of a population.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are two crucial techniques used in the networking world for data dissemination. They function by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the reverse direction of their normal data flow. This way, they help to minimize the chances of packet duplication in the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding operates by having each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from sender, S, through neighbor, N, it checks its routing table to see if it would forward packets to S through N. If so, it will only forward the packet to all other adjacent nodes except for N. This is based on the assumption that the packet took the optimal route until then.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting involves nodes monitoring unicast traffic to determine which paths they are a part of in the network. This is achieved\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of networking, Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are indispensable methods employed for data dissemination. They work by enabling nodes to propagate data packets against their standard data flow course. Consequently, these techniques significantly reduce the likelihood of packet replication within the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding comes into play when each node in the network maintains a routing table based on unicast routing protocols. Should node X obtain a packet from sender S through intermediary node N, it consults its routing table to confirm whether it would pass data packets to S via N. If the affirmative response is obtained, node X then forwards the packet to all other neighboring nodes except for N. This action is rooted in the belief that the packet had adopted the most efficient path up until that juncture.\n\nIn contrast, Reverse Path Broad",

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The property which makes a spanning trees quite appealing for broadcast and multicast applications is that there exists a minimal amount of copies in the network. Furthermore, a spanning tree does not contain any loops. Spanning trees can be used with Link State Routing in the following manner: All intermediate systems (IS) broadcast Link State packets containing distances to neighbor nodes as well as information on multicast groups at regular intervals. With the help of this information each node can calculate a multicast tree and use it to determine the outgoing lines on which packets will be transmitted.",

        "provided_answer": "The solution for maintaining a high collision domain diameter with increased transmission speed is to also increase the length of the sent frames. Frame bursting in this context means combining multiple small frames to one concatenated sequence of then increased length. This allows collision detection on the same length of line as before with increased speed because incread sequence length and higher transmission speed together mean a unchanged duration of transmission for every node in the network. \nWe have to have a look on the advantages and disadvantages of frame bursting, especially in comparison to carrier extension. Carrier extension is another attempt to longer frames by adding more zero-padding bits to every frame with the same data section length as before:\n\n-Advantage: In comparison to carrier extension, the long sequences in frame bursting contain more information, because no (or at least less) zero padding is needed. So the percentage of data per sequence is higher than it is with carrier extension, where most of the package consists of padding fields. So we have a higher efficiency, especially in respect of line usage.\n\n-Disadvantage: Frame bursting needs time of waiting for every node before sending, because a certain amount of frames has to be collected to concatenate them to a sequence of minimum length.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

The theoretical background behind the usage comes from Palm's theorem (Arrowsmith et al. 2015). It states that under suitable but mild conditions, such a large number of multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of streams grows.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

As in Link State Routing, each node knows the entire network topology (after it has been collected), it can easily compute a spanning tree with for example Kruskal\u2019s algorithm if it knows which other nodes are in the multicasting group for which the spanning tree is calculated. To make this work, Link State packets need to be expanded with information on multicast groups which require the Link States to be sent frequently (to answer the multicast queries).

        "provided_answer": "Three common techniques to tackle the issue of redundant packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented environment are as follows.\n\nFirstly, we can implement a checksum-based method. Each packet is assigned a unique checksum value, which is verified at the receiving end. If the received packet's checksum matches the sent one, the packet is considered valid, and if not, it is discarded. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, as it does not require any additional information storage or complex processing. However, the disadvantage is that it does not actually eliminate the redundant packets but merely filters them out at the receiver.\n\nSecondly, we can employ a time-based method. This involves adding a timestamp to each packet and rejecting any packet that arrives too late compared to the expected packet arrival time based on the connection's negotiated data transfer rate. The advantage of this method is its efficiency, as it does not require any\"\nstorage or processing at the receiver, and it only discards packets that are clearly out of order or delayed. However, the disadvantage is that it can result in some legitimate packets being discarded if there is significant delay or network congestion.\n\nThirdly, we can utilize a sequence number-based method. This technique involves assigning a unique sequence number to each packet and rejecting any packet that does not have a valid sequence number or has an out-of-order sequence number. The advantage of this method is its ability to eliminate redundant packets at the sender itself and prevent them from being transmitted, thus reducing the overall network load. However, the disadvantage is that it requires additional storage and processing at the sender to maintain the sequence numbers and keep track of the acknowledged packets.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In a connection-oriented setting, there are three primary strategies to address the challenge of excessive packets on the transport layer.\n\nTo begin with",

UDP, being a connectionless protocol, has a much simpler header structure than TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that the UDP header (8 bytes) is significantly shorter than the TCP header (20 bytes). Another key difference lies in the number of fields they contain. While UDP has a fixed header length, TCP headers can vary in length due to the inclusion of additional fields such as the sequence number, acknowledgment number, and reserved space. However, I must admit that I was mistaken when I assumed the UDP header did not contain a packet length field.

UDP boasts a consistent header length, whereas the length of TCP headers can fluctuate owing to the incorporation of additional elements like sequence number, acknowledgment number, and allocated space.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS.

In the loss recovery stage, the congestion window (cwnd) is quickly increased to compensate for the lost packets, while in the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid further packet loss. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with every acknowledgement, leading to an exponential growth. Conversely, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half every time a packet is lost. These adaptations help to balance the network traffic and maintain a stable connection. However, it's important to note that these phases and their mechanisms are not explicitly named \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\" in the TCP protocol specification.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"TCP congestion control is composed of two primary elements: loss recovery and backoff. During the loss recovery phase, the congestion window (cwnd) is expanded to account for dropped packets, while in the backoff phase, cwnd is diminished to prevent more losses. Throughout the loss recovery period, cwnd expands by a factor of two with each acknowledgement received, leading to an exponential expansion. In contrast, during the backoff phase, cwnd is halved every time a packet is lost. Such adjustments enable the management of network traffic and the preservation of a stable link.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "The main difference between asynchronous and synchronous data transmission modes lies in the usage or non-usage of clock signals. Unlike synchronous transmission which depends on clock signals to maintain synchronization, asynchronous transmission operates without the need for such signals. Moreover, in asynchronous transmission, each character is encoded as a separate entity, while in synchronous transmission, multiple characters are bundled together as a continuous bitstream. It's important to note that the slower transmission rates in asynchronous transmission are mainly attributed to the need to add start and stop bits for each character, whereas synchronous transmission can deliver faster data rates by compressing multiple bits into a single frame. Contrary to a widely held view, the utilization of flags to distinguish frames in synchronous transmission does not inherently add intricacy. The primary factor contributing to complexity is the necessity for synchronization between the sender and the receiver. I think the misconception originates",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic follow a Poisson process may be an oversimplification, but it remains a reasonable approximation. Although packets may appear in bursts, they may also be uniformly spaced. Therefore, it is plausible to consider arrivals as independent events within a small time window, especially when it comes to large data sets. For example, in a study that analyzes traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources. However, it is important to remember that this assumption may not be true in all cases, and more complex models, such as Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be necessary to capture the nuances of Internet traffic in the real world.\"Reformated answer: In the scope of Internet traffic analysis, the assumption that package arrivals adhere to a Poisson process is commonly used, although it could be an excessive simplification of research patterns.",

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the context of modeling packet arrivals as a poisson process, the assumption that arrivals for each time interval are independent is fundamental. This is also true for actual Internet traffic. In fact, the very nature of a poisson process implies that each arrival is a random event that occurs with a constant rate, and that there is no correlation between arrivals. It is important to remember that, while actual Internet traffic may present bursts, these bursts are simply the result of variable rates and not a violation of the assumption of independence. In essence, the arrival process remains random, which makes the assumption of independence valid.\"Reformulated answer: \"The key assumption underlying the use of a Poisson process to model packet arrivals is the independence of arrivals for each time interval.This principle applies not only to simulated traffic, but also to Internet traffic in the real world.The essence of a Poisson process lies in the fact that each arrival is an isolated and random event with a consistent arrival rate, without connection to arrivals.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "RPF: Each sender has its own Spanning Tree. A node receives a packet. If it has arrived at the usual entry link, it assumes the packet used the best route until now and resend over all edges (not including the incoming one). If it entries trough another link it will assume its a duplicate and discards it (spanning tree).  It ensures a loop-free forwarding of multicast packets as duplicates are discarded. RPF: It works like RPF but with a specific selection of the outgoing links. It optimizies the disadvantage of RPF of resending over all edges. If the packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this station/source are usually sent and the packet used the best route it forwards the packets only over suitable edges, i.e. it selects the the edge from which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to the source in reversed direction.

Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information  (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)",
        "provided_answer": "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a networking protocol that manages the assignment of static IP addresses to devices on a network. It's an alternative to static IP addressing, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors when configuring large networks. DHCP offers several advantages, such as centralized management, ease of configuration, and faster network setup. However, it's not as secure as static IP addressing because it relies on broadcast messages for address assignments, making it vulnerable to IP address spoofing. In contrast, RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) and BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) were early solutions for automatic IP address assignment, but they have been largely replaced by DHCP due to its flexibility and scalability.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"The function of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is to allocate IP addresses dynamically to network devices. This is a substitute for the traditional method of assigning static IPs, which can be laborious and error-prone when handling extensive networks. DHCP boasts various benefits, including centralized administration, simplified configuration, and expedited network initialization. Nevertheless, it lacks the security of static IP addressing because it utilizes broadcast messages for IP address allotment, making it susceptible to IP address forgery.

It is a simple and effective method, but the endsystems have to be capable of storing the necessary information. A connection-oriented system is also required.The last approach is to identify PDUs individually where every PDU has a individual sequential number assigned to it and it will basically neber be reset, making this method convenient, but at the cost of a higher usage of bandwidth and memory.

Conversely, in the congestion avoidance phase, the ss_thresh is adjusted based on package loss, and the cwnd is reset to a lower value, usually half of the current cwnd. This mechanism helps TCP to maintain a stable connection and adapt to changing network conditions. However, it is important to note that this description may vary slightly depending on the specific TCP implementation.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in modeling packet arrivals as a Poisson process is not only applicable to internet traffic but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may exhibit some burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Moreover, the burstiness in real traffic can often be modeled as superpositions of multiple Poisson processes, each representing different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the independence assumption. Thus, even if real traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in the packet arrivals is still a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Poisson process, which is the foundation of many statistical models, including internet traffic analysis, assumes packet arrivals to be independent. This simplification greatly facilitates the computation of probabilities and expected values. Although real-world traffic might exhibit burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a suitable approximation for specific scenarios, such as short and infrequent bursts. Moreover, the complexity of real traffic can be broken down into several Poisson processes, each representing distinct traffic types or sources, maintaining the assumption of independence. Even if the real traffic deviates from a perfectly Poissonian distribution, the assumption of independence in packet arrivals remains a valuable foundation for analyzing and modeling the system.",

Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",
        "provided_answer": "In this system, we have an average of 9 packages that arrive per second and 10 packages that are served per second. Since there is a buffer of size 10, we anticipate that the server would process a new package every second. Since the server is constantly serving packages, it is reasonable to assume that the queue would never be empty or would have less than 10 packages waiting. Therefore, we would not expect the system to spend time with less than 10 packages in the queue. Explanation: Although the student recognizes arrival and service rates, they incorrectly assume that the server would always process a new package every second due to the average service rate. This assumption ignores the variability in package arrivals and service times. Therefore, their conclusion that the queue would never have less than 10 packages is incorrect.

        "provided_answer": "IPv6 was designed to only support a few thousand devices at a time. This was a major improvement over IPv4, which could only handle a few hundred. Another objective of IPv6 was to make routing tables longer and more complex. This was necessary to accommodate the larger address space. Additionally, IPv6 simplified protocol processing with a more complicated header structure. This made it easier for developers to write code, as they didn't have to worry about the complexities of IPv4 headers. Finally, IPv6 did not prioritize security at all, as it was believed that security could be added later through additional protocols. However, it turns out that IPv6's lack of built-in security features made it a prime target for hackers, and security became a major concern post-deployment.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The primary intention behind the development of IPv6 was to facilitate the connection of only a limited number of devices at any given time. In comparison to IPv4, which could only manage a couple of hundred devices, IPv6 represented a significant leap forward. Moreover, a longer and more intricate routing table was deemed essential to accommodate the expanded address space of IPv6. In addition to this, IPv6 streamlined protocol processing with a more intricate header format. This simplification allowed developers to focus on their code without being burdened by the complexities of IPv4 headers. Lastly, security considerations were entirely disregarded during the design phase of IPv6, with the belief that security could be addressed later via additional protocols. Regrettably, this oversight led to IPv6 becoming a prime target for cyber-attacks, and security has emerged as a critical issue post-implementation.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "provided_answer": "Given the high channel load and budget constraints, I would recommend a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) as the MAC procedure for the new LAN setup.\n\nFirstly, CSMA/CA is relatively simple in terms of its implementation and doesn't require dedicated time slots or complex reservation mechanisms, which reduces the hardware requirements and costs associated with other MAC procedures. Additionally, it can effectively handle high channel loads due to its collision avoidance feature, where devices listen before transmitting to minimize chances of collisions.\n\nHowever, one potential weakness of CSMA/CA is its susceptibility to hidden node problems, where two devices within the LAN range of each other but out of direct line-of-sight, may transmit at the same time, causing collisions. Moreover, in a high contention environment, the average waiting time for devices to gain access to the channel can increase, leading to lower overall through\"\n\nRephrased answer: The suggested MAC (Medium Access Control) method for the upcoming LAN configuration, considering the heavy network traffic and financial limitations, is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).\n\nInitially, CSMA/CA is known for its ease of implementation as it doesn't necessitate intricate time slots or advanced reservation methods, thereby reducing the need for expensive hardware components compared to other MAC methods. Furthermore, CSMA/CA's collision avoidance functionality is advantageous in managing high channel loads, as devices wait before transmitting to minimize the risk of collisions.\n\nDespite its strengths, CSMA/CA comes with certain shortcomings. One such limitation is its vulnerability to hidden node issues, where two devices within the LAN's range but not in direct sight, may concurrently transmit, resulting in collisions.

Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "In the Data Link Layer, asynchronous transmission is characterized by its speed, as it allows for multiple characters to be transmitted at once due to the absence of flag bits. Synchronous transmission, on the other hand, is slower as it insists on using flag bits to separate each character, making it a more laborious and outdated method.\n\nI believe this answer is incorrect because it gets the role of start and stop bits and flag bits reversed. The reference answer states that asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits for each character, while synchronous transmission uses flags (or SYN) to define frames. In this answer, it states that asynchronous transmission doesn't use flags, but instead allows for multiple characters to be transmitted at once. This is incorrect. Additionally, it asserts that asynchronous transmission is faster, while the reference states that it actually has lower transmission rates due to the need for additional start and stop bits.\"\n\nRephrased answer: At the Data Link Layer, asynchronous transmission is marked by its efficiency, enabling the concurrent transmission of numerous characters due to the omission of demarcation flags. In contrast, synchronous transmission is less productive since it persistently applies flags to segregate each character, thereby necessitating more effort and appearing more antiquated.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this response contains inaccuracies. In truth, asynchronous transmission utilizes start and stop bits to distinguish the beginning and end of each character, while synchronous transmission relies on flags or SYN to distinguish frames. The present answer asserts that asynchronous transmission doesn't make use of flags but instead permits multiple characters to be sent simultaneously. This assertion is incorrect.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

The primary reason for this recommendation is that RLE is an effective lossless data compression technique and is particularly beneficial when dealing with data with repetitive patterns, which is often the case in network traffic. Additionally, the absence of clock drift and varying ticking rates in this network setup makes RLE a favorable choice since it does not require any clock synchronization or clock recovery mechanisms. However, it's important to note that RLE may not be the most efficient encoding technique in terms of bandwidth, as it might not provide the full bit per baud that Binary Encoding offers. Nevertheless, its ability to reduce the redundancy in the data, combined with the network's perfect clock setup, makes it a suitable encoding method for this specific use case.\"\n\nRephrased answer: With a local network configuration consisting of three interlinked users and precise clocks, I propose implementing Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for encoding bitstreams. My rationale for this suggestion is that RLE represents an efficient lossless data compression technique, especially when handling data with recurring patterns, a common characteristic of network traffic. Moreover, the advantage of having identical clocks without drift or varying ticking rates within this network setup further bolsters the appeal of RLE due to its elimination of the need for clock synchronization or recovery mechanisms. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that RLE might not yield the maximum bit per baud attainable through Binary Encoding. Nevertheless, RLE's ability to minimize data redundancy, in conjunction with the network's ideal clock arrangement, renders it an appropriate encoding technique for this particular application.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

This holds true for real internet traffic as well. In fact, the very nature of a poisson process implies that each arrival is a random event occurring with a constant rate, and that there is no correlation between arrivals. It's important to remember that while real internet traffic may exhibit bursts, these bursts are simply a result of varying rates and not a violation of the independence assumption.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in modeling packet arrivals as a Poisson process is not only applicable to internet traffic but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may exhibit some burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Moreover, the burstiness in real traffic can often be modeled as superpositions of multiple Poisson processes, each representing different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the independence assumption. Thus, even if real traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in the packet arrivals is still a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.",

For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",

For instance, if the least-loaded path is selected by A to transmit data to G, but the other available paths possess lower latency, the video may suffer from lagging or freezing due to the extended delay resulting from the less-loaded path's availability.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The primary role of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting is to ensure that packets are delivered to their intended destination in a timely and efficient manner. This is accomplished by making use of routing information to minimize the number of duplicate packets that are transmitted throughout the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding functions by maintaining a routing table based on distance vector algorithms at each node. When a node, X, receives a packet from a sender, S, via neighbor, N, it consults its routing table and forwards the packet only to those nodes that would be its next hop if it were attempting to send a packet to S. This approach is based on the assumption that the received packet has taken the shortest path from S to X.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting relies on the nodes' ability to detect unicast traffic and determine which paths they are a part of in the network.",

With Hidden Terminals, the challenge occurs when two nodes that are not in range of each other both try to communicate with another node that they are both in reach with. For example node A and C are not in range of each other but can both communicate with node B. Now when node A sends something to B, then C cannot receive this transmission. Because of that C will think that B is free for transmission and might also send data to B. This simultaneous transmission will result in a collision and a loss of data from both A and C. With Exposed Terminals we imagine the example from above with another node D that is only in range of C. Now if B is sending data to A and C wants to send data to D. C will then see that the carrier is busy and has to wait until it detects it to be idle.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in package arrival modeling as a Poisson process is not only applicable to Internet traffic, but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the system analysis much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real world traffic may show some burst, the Poisson process may remain a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Furthermore, the explosion in real traffic can often be modeled as overlaps of multiple Poisson processes, each of which represents different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the assumption of independence. Thus, even if actual traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in package arrivals remains a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.",

Instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control",
        "provided_answer": "The three services are called Unconfirmed Connectionless Service, Confirmed Connectionless Service and Connection-Oriented Service. These differ in their characteristics and areas of application. The first two services differ in whether or not the receiver acknowledges a packet when it receives it. The Unconfirmed Connectionless service does not include confirmation and assumes that the sent packets have arrived correctly. By confirming in the Confirmed Connectionless  service, this service can ensure that all packets have arrived at the receiver. Lost packets cannot be confirmed and so the recipient sends the packet again after a specified timeout. Both mentioned services have no flow control and no explicit requests to establish or disconnect a connection. The Confirmed Connectionless service has an implicit confirmation if a connection can be established, exactly when its packets are confirmed by the receiver. The confirmation of the second service class can cause duplicates to appear at the receiver, when the confirmation of a packet does not arrive at the sender. The third service class executes a three-phase communication and tries to establish a connection first. If the connection is confirmed, packets are sent until a request for disconnection is sent and confirmed. If the communication takes place over an error-free channel, no losses, no duplicates and no sequence errors are to be expected. Flow control is guaranteed by the \"handshake\". The first service type is usually used for the transition of isolated single units in channels with very low error rate (e.g. LANs, voice communication). The second service type can be used for channels with a high error rate such as mobile communication. The last service type is preferred for long and persistent communication.",

This recorded information is then utilized in the forwarding phase to ensure that data is transmitted to the correct destination via the most optimal path. For instance, if a device is located on a network segment connected to the bridge via interface A, and a data packet destined for that device is received on interface B, the bridge will add an entry to its database indicating that device X can be reached via interface B.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

Meaning that two terminals A and C can communicate with another terminal B but because A is out of reach for C and C is out of reach for A they do not know when the other one is sending something. Which can cause interference at terminal B. Another challenge are so called Exposed Terminals. If many radio ranges of terminals overlap, a terminal will always wait if it recognises somebody else sending in its range. Even if it would not cause interference in some cases because the waiting terminal would like to send to someone else who is not receiving anything.

Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic.\n3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. \n4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented.\nii)less congestion.\niii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.",
        "provided_answer": "Transparent bridges maintain a route table for the forwarding process. This table includes information on the shortest route to reach multiple destinations. During the learning phase, bridges receive frames and add the shortest route to the corresponding destination in the table. For example, when a bridge receives a frame with X origin address and Y destination address, check the route table to find the shortest route to Y. If there is no entry for Y, add a new entry with the shortest route. However, when a frame arrives with the same X origin address and a different Z destination address, it updates the shortest route for Z instead of adding a new entry. In the forwarding process, the bridge uses the route table to determine the shortest route to reach a destination and forwards the framework accordingly. A key benefit of this selective forwarding is the reduction of the number of frames transmitted, resulting in less congestion and better network performance.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side.

For example, in a study analyzing traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources.

In addition, there is a greater risk of errors due to the greater number of frames in transit. However, one advantage of the brilliant frame is that it can provide a smoother data flow, since smaller frames are less susceptible to congestion and loss of packages compared to large frames.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces significant challenges that are not typically present in fixed and wired networks. Two of these challenges are:\n\n1.Latency: The time taken for data packets to travel from source to destination is much higher in mobile networks due to the wireless medium and frequent topology changes. This delay can negatively impact the user experience and the overall network performance.\n\n2.Cost: Deploying and maintaining mobile routing infrastructure can be significantly more expensive compared to wired networks. This is due to the need for additional components like batteries, antennas, and processing units to ensure reliable connectivity and handling the dynamic nature of mobile networks.\n\nDespite these errors, the student answer appears coherent and related to the question. The incorrect challenges, latency and cost, are plausible challenges in mobile networks, but they are not the primary challenges discussed in the reference answer.

        "provided_answer": "If you increase the speed of a network using CSMA / CD, the collision domain diameter actually increases, not decreases. This is because faster data transfer speeds mean that packets travel across the network more quickly, and therefore collisions are more likely to occur over longer distances. So, in order to minimize the impact of collisions, the collision domain diameter must be increased to allow more space between devices. This could result in a collision domain diameter of several kilometers in a large network.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The enlargement of the network's speed through CSMA / CD leads to an expansion of the collision domain diameter contrary to the common belief. This expansion occurs since swifter data transmission enables packets to traverse the network at a greater velocity, consequently raising the likelihood of collisions over extended distances. To mitigate the consequences of collisions, the collision domain diameter is enlarged to afford a broader separation among devices.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

Outbursts in traffic are due to several factors such as congestion control, user behavior or application requirements. However, the occurrence of an arrival does not directly affect the probability of another arrival in the same interval.

        "question": "WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "Spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting due to their property of creating a loop-free network. This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes through a unique path.\n\nHowever, constructing a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known to all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link state packet as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node must first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through some other means, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can construct a multicast spanning tree using algorithms like OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can handle the distribution of group membership information along with the network topology.\n\nMaximum Marks:\"\n\nAlternative answer: The charm of spanning trees lies in their ability to produce a network devoid of loops, a trait that makes them attractive for both broadcasting and multicasting applications. This is accomplished by eliminating redundant links, ensuring that each node is connected to others via a distinctive path.\n\nNevertheless, the formation of a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing encounters certain obstacles. Given that multicast groups are not initially recognized by all intermediary nodes, we cannot integrate multicast group data into the link state packet like we would for unicast routing. Consequently, each node must initially determine which multicast groups it is a part of through alternative methods, for example, multicast membership protocols. After obtaining this knowledge, the node can establish a multicast spanning tree employing algorithms such as OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-enabled and",

Two major difficulties are as follows.\n\nFirst, mobile routing needs to adapt to the mobility of the nodes. This can be particularly challenging as nodes can move unpredictably and without warning. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of the nodes. For example, if two nodes are communicating and one moves, a new path must be established quickly to maintain the connection.\n\nSecond, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks compared to wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure the security of the network. One common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect the data.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the answer provided above is not factually incorrect, but it does not capture",

There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

Phase 2 \u2013 Congestion Avoidance: As soon as cwnd is equal or larger than ss_thresh, cwnd is increased by one each time all packets in the window are acknowledged, which results in cwnd growing linearly.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. They enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. If this is the case, no forwarding takes place to AVOID LOOPS. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (also called Reverse Path Flooding) (RPF) is a variation of the method spanning tree. Each sender has its spanning tree. The other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. The assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  The RPF algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. If yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. If not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. This duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. The significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. If a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. As soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. The disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. The REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is like RPF but with a specific selection of outgoing links. After the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. If yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S. If not, it won't send over all edges. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",

First, it allows correction of errors by comparing the difference between current and previous bits. This is essential since the network is often congested, which leads to bit errors. Second, since users have perfect watches, they can easily maintain a common frame of reference to decode differential encoded bit streams. This eliminates the need for clock synchronization protocols, thus reducing latency and improving the overall efficiency of the network. However, it is important to note that differential coding may not be the most efficient bandwidth coding technique, but it offers benefits of robustness and synchronization in this scenario.\"Reformated response: In a network with three users, differential encoding is the optimal option due to its error correction capabilities and removal of clock synchronization protocols.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The appeal of the extension of trees lies in its ability to offer routes of equal costs between all nodes, which makes them a valuable asset for both broad and multicast traffic. This property is advantageous for multicast traffic, as it ensures that all destinations receive identical data at the same moment. To adapt Link State Routing for multicast trees, we can incorporate multicast group data into the link status packages, and apply a version of the shortest route algorithm, such as the Dijkstra algorithm, to establish the multicast tree. Subsequently, each node will be limited to transmitting multicast packages across the shortest route to other nodes in the tree.

        "reference_answer": "Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nMain advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except \u201cHop-by-Hop Extension\u201d) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.",
        "provided_answer": "Extension headers in IPv6 serve a different purpose than in IPv4. Instead of adding extra information, they are used to replace the original IPv6 header with new data. They can be found at the end of the packet, just before the payload or upper-layer header. This design change offers a significant improvement in security, as extension headers can be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access or manipulation.\n\nMaximum Marks: 1.0\n\nExplanation:\nThe student answer is factually incorrect, as extension headers in IPv6 do not replace the original header but rather extend it with additional optional information. They are also located between the fixed header and the payload or upper-layer header. The answer's claim about encrypted extension headers is a misconception, as IPv6 extension headers are not encrypted by default, but they can be protected by IPsec, a separate security protocol. The answer is coherent as it\"\n\nRephrased answer: The role of extension headers in IPv6 differs from that of IPv4. Rather than appending additional information, they function to augment the original IPv6 header with new data. Contrary to common belief, extension headers do not replace the initial header, but rather come after it within the packet. This adjustment in architecture leads to enhanced security features, as extension headers can be concealed from unauthorized entities through encryption. However, it is essential to clarify that IPv6 extension headers are not inherently encrypted, but they can be shielded through the deployment of IPsec.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in package arrival modeling as a Poisson process is not only applicable to Internet traffic, but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, which allows us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may show some burst, the Poisson process may remain a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Furthermore, the burst in real traffic can often be modeled as overlaps of multiple Poisson processes, each of which represents different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the assumption of independence. Thus, even if the actual traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in package arrivals remains a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.\"",

At this point, the protocol enters the Congestion Avoidance phase, where the cwnd is incremented based on the number of segments received. The threshold remains constant during this phase.

        "provided_answer": "The primary objectives of IPv6 are to improve internet performance and to decrease the number of available IP addresses.\nAlthough, some may argue that security is also a goal, but it's more of a nice-to-have feature rather than a fundamental objective.\nIPv6 was designed to address the issue of limited IP addresses by increasing the address length from 32 bits to 128 bits. This allows for an exponentially larger number of addresses, enabling better internet connectivity for more devices. Additionally, IPv6 strives to enhance internet performance by simplifying the header structure and reducing the overhead associated with routing. These improvements lead to faster data transfer and a more efficient use of network resources.\nDespite the importance of these objectives, it's important to note that IPv6 is not without its challenges. For instance, the increased address length can lead to compatibility issues with older systems and protocols. Therefore, it's crucial that\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"The fundamental aims of IPv6 include enhancing internet performance and tackling the scarcity of IP addresses.\nHowever, while some may contend that enhanced security is another key objective, it's more accurate to consider it as a desirable addition rather than a core objective.\nIPv6 was engineered to tackle the IP address shortage by expanding the address length from 32 bits to 128 bits. This expansion results in a significantly larger address pool, promoting improved internet connectivity for a greater number of devices. Furthermore, IPv6 aspires to optimize internet performance through the streamlining of header design and decreased routing overhead. The outcome is accelerated data transfer and a more economical utilization of network resources.\nNevertheless, it's essential to acknowledge that IPv6 encounters certain hurdles.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The main objective of the network is to optimize and speed up the delivery of packages to its intended receivers. They achieve this by reducing the diffusion of redundant packets over the network, which is achieved through the application of routing data. The network works by implementing a routing table in each node using vector distance algorithms. When a node, X, obtains a packet from the sender, S, through intermediary, N, consults its routing table and disseminates the package exclusively to the nodes that would be its subsequent jumps in case of transmitting a package to S. This strategy is based on the belief that the package received originated from the most direct route between S and X.

        "reference_answer": "Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5.

        "provided_answer": "First, RLE is known for its excellent compression capabilities, especially when it comes to repeated data sequences, which is common in network traffic. Second, since all users have perfect clocks, there will be no significant delay or nervousness in the network, which will make it easier for RLE to maintain the correct sequence of data. However, this recommendation may not be the most optimal option in terms of bandwidth efficiency compared to binary encoding. However, it could be a viable option depending on the specific requirements and limitations of the network.\" Reformulated response: The proposed network configuration suggests using network length encoding (RLE) as a bittreams coding method. Given its exceptional compression performance when handling data with continuous repetition, RLE deserves serious consideration. Furthermore, because all connected devices have synchronized watches, network latency and inconsistencies, so it is easier for RLE to maintain the proper data sequence.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

This is because each package is sent separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packages.

Instead, it suggests that the distribution of package arrivals may be non-Poissonian, but actual arrivals remain independent events.\"Reformulated answer: The independence of package arrivals in the Internet context should not be underestimated.Each package is sent individually from its origin and has no relation whatsoever to the delivery of subsequent packets.Although there may be occurrences of traffic bursts in the use of the Internet in real life, it does not deny the fact that the independence of package arrivals persists.What this indicates is that the pattern of package arrivals might deviate from a Poisson distribution, but the occurrence of each package is an independent event.",

        "provided_answer": "To employ the piggybacking extension to the sliding window protocol, it is crucial that the bandwidth between the sender and receiver is sufficient enough to accommodate both data and acknowledgement frames. This means that the connection must be full-duplex, allowing for simultaneous data transmission and reception. However, I believe the actual requirement is that the sender and receiver have a reliable and error-free communication channel to prevent the need for explicit acknowledgements, rather than the ability to transmit and receive frames concurrently. This misconception arises from confusing the benefits of piggybacking with its prerequisites.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The necessity for an adequate bandwidth in the communication channel between the sender and receiver when implementing the piggybacking extension to the sliding window protocol stems from the requirement for both data and acknowledgement frames to be transmitted. Consequently, this connection needs to be full-duplex, enabling concurrent data transfer and reception. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that the true condition is a dependable and error-free communication link for obviating the need for explicit confirmations, rather than the ability to send and receive packets synchronously.

Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",

Explanation: The student's response is factually incorrect by stating that the use of the current load to find the best route can lead to further loss of packages.

        "reference_answer": "Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nMain advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except \u201cHop-by-Hop Extension\u201d) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.",

While in IPv4 they are located at the end of the packet after the payload and transport layer headers, in IPv6 they can be found right after the IPv6 header. The main disadvantage of extension headers in IPv6 is that they add unnecessary complexity to the header structure, leading to potential processing delays.\n\nThis answer is incorrect because extension headers in IPv6 are indeed located between the IPv6 header and the payload or upper-layer header/transport-layer header, not after the payload. The main disadvantage stated in the answer is also incorrect as extension headers in IPv6 actually offer advantages such as allowing new options to be added without changing the header and simpler processing for intermediate devices when most options are ignored.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The placement of extension headers in IPv6 packets differs from IPv4. Contrary to IPv4, where they appear at the conclusion of the packet following the payload and transport layer headers, IPv6 extension headers can be situated directly after the IPv6 header. However, the inclusion of extension headers in IPv6 introduces an added level of intricacy to the header configuration, potentially leading to processing latencies.\n\nThis answer, despite being incorrect, maintains the original statement's flawed reasoning, albeit with different wording and sentence structure.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenge in mobile routing is the limited bandwidth available in wireless networks compared to fixed and wired networks. This can result in slow data transfer speeds and increased latency. Another challenge is the lack of standardization, as there are various routing protocols and technologies used in mobile networks, making it difficult to ensure interoperability and compatibility.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of mobile routing, a primary hurdle arises from the narrower bandwidth of wireless networks compared to their wired and fixed counterparts. Consequences of this bandwidth disparity consist of sluggish data transmission velocities and heightened latency. Additionally, the absence of uniformity in this domain poses another problem, as multiple routing protocols and technologies coexist within mobile networks, creating difficulties in achieving harmonious interoperability and compatibility.",

First, it allows correction of errors by comparing the difference between the current and previous bits. This is essential since the network is often congested, which leads to bit errors.

This eliminates the need for clock synchronization protocols, thus reducing latency and improving the overall efficiency of the network.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

        "provided_answer": "In the TCP congestion control lecture, there are two primary phases: Congestion Avoidance and Slow Start. During Slow Start, the Congestion Window (cwnd) and Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) function in tandem. The cwnd is incremented by the sender after receiving an acknowledgement, while the ss_thresh remains stagnant, acting as a cap for the cwnd growth. However, in the Congestion Avoidance phase, the roles reverse. The ss_thresh is adjusted dynamically based on network conditions, while the cwnd remains constant. When a packet loss occurs, the ss_thresh is halved and the cwnd is reset to a smaller value. This is to prevent further packet loss and maintain network stability.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The TCP Congestion Control instruction comprises two major parts: Congestion Avoidance and Slow Start. In the Slow Start segment, the Congestion Window (cwnd) and Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) operate in unison. The cwnd expands following the arrival of an acknowledgement, whereas the ss_thresh remains unchanged, restricting the cwnd expansion. In contrast, during Congestion Avoidance, the duties of the ss_thresh and cwnd swap. The ss_thresh undergoes modification depending on the network situation, while the cwnd maintains a steady state. When a packet loss transpires, the ss_thresh is decreased by half and the cwnd is reverted to a smaller value.

Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",
        "provided_answer": "In this system, we have an average of 9 packets arriving per second and 10 packets being served per second. Given that there is a buffer of size 10, we would anticipate that the server would be processing a new packet every second. Since the server is consistently serving packets, it's reasonable to assume that the queue would never be empty or have less than 10 packets waiting. Thus, we would not expect the system to spend any time with fewer than 10 packets in the queue.\n\nExplanation:\nAlthough the student acknowledges the arrival and service rates, they incorrectly assume that the server would always be processing a new packet every second due to the average service rate. This assumption disregards the variability in packet arrivals and service times. Therefore, their conclusion that the queue would never have fewer than 10 packets is incorrect. They don't provide any justification or calculations in their answer.\"\n\nRephrased answer:\nWith an average of 9 packets entering and 10 packets leaving the system per second, one might infer that the server is handling a fresh packet each second considering the mean service rate. However, it is essential to consider that packet arrivals and services may not be consistently uniform. Consequently, it's potentially erroneous to assert that the queue would persistently contain no less than 10 packets, as the student suggests. There's no supporting evidence or calculations presented in their answer to back up this conclusion.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

This is because each package is sent separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packages.

Second, it can support a large number of users, making it scalable for the company's future growth.\n\nHowever, a potential weakness of using Pure ALOHA is its high collision rate. Since all devices transmit data without coordinating with each other, there is a high probability of data collisions, which can lead to retransmissions and increased network congestion.

The primary justification behind this suggestion is that ALOHA does not necessitate any expensive hardware or centralized management, making it an economical option. Moreover, its ability to accommodate a vast number of users renders it an appealing alternative for the company's anticipated expansion.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that Pure ALOHA comes with a significant drawback in the form of a high collision rate.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

This method is opposed to the aggregation of frames, where several frames are combined into a large frame. A major disadvantage of the bursting of frames is that it requires more control signaling, making it less efficient than the extension of the carrier. In addition, there is a greater risk of errors due to the greater number of frames in transit.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

In addition, it can effectively handle high channel loads due to its collision avoidance function, where devices listen before transmitting to minimize collision possibilities. However, a potential weakness of CSMA/CA is its susceptibility to hidden node problems, where two devices within the LAN range among themselves, but out of direct line of view, can transmit at the same time, causing collisions.

A disadvantage is that some services are per convention reached on a well-known TSAP (like e.g. a webserver at TCP port 80), where changing TSAPs would complicate finding the correct TSAP to connect to.Individual identification of connections: This method addresses duplicates by assigning each connection a SeqNo meaning a unique identifier that is remembered by the participating endsystems. This has the advantage that services can still be assigned to any well-known TSAP without conflict and this method solves receiving duplicate packages from a connection that has already been closed. A disadvantage is that the endsystems need to remember all previously assigned sequence numbers and those also need to be readily available, which would not be the case when e.g. the system is offline.Individual identification of PDUs: This method addresses duplicates be assigning each single PDU in all connections a unique SeqNo. This has the advantage that it definitely allows for uniquely identifying a package and immediately seeing whether we have seen this exact package before (and e.g. not just a equal package within the same connection). The disadvantage is that we have an increased overhead for duplicate detection as we have to maintain the numbering for each package.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenges of Mobile Routing differ significantly from those faced in fixed and wired networks. First, the mobility of nodes causes signal interferences, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss.

        "provided_answer": "When dealing with duplicate packets on the transport layer of a connection-oriented service, three common methods can be employed to mitigate this issue, each with its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nFirst, the use of checksums. Checksums provide a method to verify the integrity of transmitted data. In the event that duplicate packets are detected, the receiving end can discard the one with the incorrect checksum. This method has the advantage of being simple and effective. However, it relies on the sender and receiver to implement checksum verification and may not be able to distinguish between duplicate packets sent intentionally or due to network errors.\n\nSecond, selective acknowledgment. In this method, the receiver sends an acknowledgement for each packet it receives correctly, while discarding any duplicates. This method allows the receiver to request retransmission of packets that were lost or corrupted, rather than all packets as in the case of stop-and-wait\"\n\nRephrased answer: Duplicating packets on a connection-oriented service's transport layer can pose a problem, but there are three popular methods to address this issue, each with pros and cons.\n\nInitially, the application of checksums. Checksums enable the confirmation of data's authenticity during transmission. When duplicates are identified, the receiving side can discard the erroneous one based on the incorrect checksum. While this method is straightforward and efficient, it assumes that both sender and receiver have implemented checksum verification, and it may not distinguish between deliberate or unintentional duplicate packets.\n\nSecondly, selective acknowledgement. With this approach, the receiver acknowledges each correctly received packet while disregarding duplicates. This strategy empowers the receiver to request retransmission of specific packets lost or damaged, as opposed to retransmitting all packets, like in stop-and-wait.",

See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "question": "Assume you have a local network with 3 users that are all interconnected and have perfect clocks. Typically the network is often congested as all users generate more traffic than the link\u2019s capacities. Which of the encoding techniques introduced in the lecture should be used in this network to encode bitstreams? Give two reasons for your answer in 2-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",
        "provided_answer": "Considering the network has 3 users, Differential Encoding is the best option. First, it allows for error correction by comparing the difference between the current and previous bits. This is essential as the network is often congested, leading to bit errors. Second, since users have perfect clocks, they can easily maintain a common reference frame for decoding the differential encoded bitstreams. This eliminates the need for clock synchronization protocols, thereby reducing latency and improving overall network efficiency. However, it is important to note that Differential Encoding may not be the most bandwidth-efficient encoding technique, but it offers robustness and synchronization benefits in this scenario.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In a network with three users, Differential Encoding is the optimal choice due to its error correction capabilities and elimination of clock synchronization protocols. Differential Encoding compares the difference between successive bits to correct errors, a vital feature in a network prone to congestion and resulting bit errors. Moreover, as all users possess precise clocks, they can effortlessly synchronize their decoding of the differential encoded bitstreams, obviating the need for complex clock synchronization protocols and significantly reducing latency. Although Differential Encoding is not the most economical encoding technique regarding bandwidth, its ability to ensure error-free decoding and synchronization in this context makes it a superior choice.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue.

This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

Calculate probability of system being in requested state:\nThe requirement of having less than 10 packets in the queue is equivalent to the system not being blocked (full) because of D=N=10. Since the distribution is memoryless and we've reached equilibrium, the probability that the system is in a certain state does not depend on the time.\nWe have a finite queue, so there is a finite set of not-blocking states plus one blocking state.\n\nAs N=10, we need to calculate P[Blocking] = p_N = p_10 = ( (1-\u03c1)/\u03c1^10 ) / ( 1-\u03c1^(10+1) ) = 0.05081.\nIt follows that P[Not Blocking] = 1 - P[Blocking] = 0.94919.\n\n4.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "We learned about Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. Reverse Path Forwarding / Reverse Path Flooding: The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. Therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. The spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. There can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: Is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to S? - If it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - Otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. Reverse Path Broadcast The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. It basically works as Reverse Path Forwarding with one difference: When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. A node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "One challenge in mobile routing is the so-called hidden terminal problem. As nodes have an inherently limited transmission range, different nodes in the network may be located to far from each other to directly be able to communicate. However, there can be other nodes in the intersection range of these nodes that can send and receive to/ from both sides, increasing the risk of transmission collisions from the hidden nodes. Also, the limited transmission range itself poses a challenge fro mobile routing as the signal strength of a sending node decreases proportionally to the square of the distance. Therefor, stronger signals from nearer nodes can completely overwrite weaker signals from more distant nodes.",

Once a packet arrived at a IS there are two possible ways to forward: (assuming shortest path transmission/\u201dbest route\u201d) * Once a packet arrived from node A on the same link as node B expect packets by its routing table, then this packet will be forwarded to all other links except the incoming link. * Once a packet arrived from node A on another link as node B expect packets from A, then this packet will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): Works like RPF but chooses specific links for the outgoing traffic. By forwarding unicast packets an IS e.g. M learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node S and D). If this is not the case and S is sending a broadcasting packet, M would not forward this packet towards D as it knows that it is not on the shortest path from S to D. If M has learned that it is on the shortest path, it will obviously forward a broadcast packet to the destination. Depending on whether a certain path is used for unicast packets, an IS will use it to forward broadcast packets or omits the packets. Thus, the overall network throughput is reduced.",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. They will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. Every receiving node has to \"ask itself the question\": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to \"ask itself\" two questions. First \"has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will \"ask itself\" the next question. \"Have the packets used the BEST route until now?\" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenges of Mobile Routing differ significantly from those faced in fixed and wired networks. First, nodes' mobility causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss. This is because moving nodes can easily disrupt the alignment of their antennas, causing their signals to clash. Second, due to the inherent limitations of battery power, mobile devices must conserve energy as much as possible. This requirement makes it essential to find energy-efficient routing algorithms that minimize power consumption while still ensuring good connectivity and maintaining network integrity.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The complexities of Mobile Routing starkly contrast with those encountered in stable, wired networks. Primarily, the mobility of nodes generates interference, potentially disrupting data transmission and inducing data loss. The reason being, nodes in motion can disrupt the alignment of their antennas, resulting in conflicting signals. Furthermore, due to battery constraints, mobile devices must conserve energy by all means necessary. Consequently, the development of energy-efficient routing algorithms is crucial to minimize power usage, while still ensuring reliable connectivity and network security.",

This is the case, when packets with a certain destination node ALWAYS take this exact IS port. In this way, the broadcast is done by using unicast paths. All other packets are not transmitted.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The functions of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) in networks that possess broadcasting capabilities lie in determining the optimal routes between senders and receivers. This is achieved by disseminating packets throughout the network. Intermediate nodes, upon receiving these packets, will distribute them to all neighboring nodes, excluding the one from where they originally received the packet. Through this method, the network is able to identify the most suitable path by monitoring the origin of incoming packets and assessing whether they have followed the best route.

        "provided_answer": "However, the disadvantage of this technique is that it requires precise time and synchronization between frames, which can be difficult to achieve in practice. Furthermore, the bursting of frames may not be suitable for applications with real-time requirements, as the delay introduced by the burst mechanism may affect latency. Advantage: One advantage of the bursting of frames over the carrier extension is that it reduces the number of control messages sent during transmission, resulting in less overload and better performance. Disadvantage: However, the bursting of frames may also lead to further delay due to the need to wait for multiple frames to accumulate before transmitting them in an explosion, which may negatively affect the system response.

This difference arises from the fact that UDP does not include some fields present in TCP, such as the sequence and recognition numbers. On the other hand, TCP has optional fields, including the sender port, which UDP does not have. Another key difference is that UDP is a offline protocol, which means that it does not establish a specific connection before sending data, unlike TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol.

        "reference_answer": "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used in Internet Protocol (IP) networks, whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network. Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information  (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)",
        "provided_answer": "Without DHCP or similar protocols, the administrator of a network element or computer needs to assign an unused IP address in the adequate network range to the device by hand.\nDHCP is a protocol to ease this process and to provide network elements with an IP address in an automated way. This can be a manual or an automatic assignment. In manual mode, a specific IP address will be permanently assigned to a certain MAC address. In automatic mode, an IP address will be temporarily assigned (lease) and freed if no renewal occurs. This provides efficient use of addresses without blocking addresses if no device uses it. The DHCP server is configured to manage a pool of possible IP addresses in the network and also knows other configuration data (e.g. DNS, netmask).\nThe DHCP protocol also allows to configure the network elements with other important network details like DNS servers, netmask, default router, and other items. If a network element needs to join a network, it sends a broadcast message (DISCOVER) to the network. A DHCP server picks this message up and provides the necessary information to the network element as described above. There should not be more than 1 DHCP server in a network. If the DHCP server resides on another LAN segment, a DHCP relay agent can forward the respective messages to/from the DHCP server.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic follow a Poisson process may be an oversimplification, but it remains a reasonable approximation. Although packets may appear in bursts, they may also be uniformly spaced. Therefore, it is plausible to consider arrivals as independent events within a small time window, especially when it comes to large data sets. For example, in a study that analyzes traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources. However, it is important to remember that this assumption may not be true in all cases, and more complex models, such as Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be necessary to capture the nuances of Internet traffic in the real world.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals:  Two nodes A and C try to communicate with a third node B, however A and C are not aware of the other station respectively because they are not within range of each other. Node B is within range of both though, therefore collisions happen and the data which is sent to B get corrupted. Exposed Terminals:  There are four nodes A,B,C,D. If node C is within range of node B and B is sending data to A, C will notice that B is currently sending and will wait until B is finished before starting to send it's own data.  However, if the destination of B's transmission (in this case A) is not within range of C, and C wants to send data to D, there actually is no risk of collisions and C would be free send. That fact that C will wait for B to finish results in unused bandwidth. (  [ A  { B ) | C ] D } |  (.) = A's range [ ] = B's range { } = C's range || = D's range",

        "provided_answer": "The Data Link Layer provides three primary functions for data transmission: 1) Unreliable Connectionless, 2) Reliable Connectionless, and 3) Connection-oriented.\n\nThe Unreliable Connectionless class is the simplest service offered by the Data Link Layer. In this mode, data is transmitted without any acknowledgment or error checking. As a result, data loss is possible during transmission. Moreover, there is no flow control, and the connection between sender and receiver can be established or terminated at any time without a formal process.\n\nNext, we have the Reliable Connectionless service class. This service provides a reliable means of data transmission, as it includes the use of acknowledgments (ACKs). However, unlike connection-oriented services, there is no flow control mechanism to manage the rate at which data is sent. As a result, potential duplicates and sequence errors may occur.\n\nFinally, the\"\nConnection-oriented \"service class is the most reliable one offered by the Data Link Layer. In this mode, a dedicated connection is established between the sender and receiver. This connection remains active until the data transfer is complete. Moreover, error control mechanisms, such as Stop and Wait and Selective Repeat, are used to ensure data integrity. Additionally, flow control mechanisms, such as sliding windows, are employed to prevent data overflow and ensure that the receiver can handle the incoming data rate.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The Data Link Layer performs three fundamental roles in data transfer: 1) Unreliable Connectionless, 2) Reliable Connectionless, and 3) Connection-oriented.\n\nThe Unreliable Connectionless function is the most elementary provision from the Data Link Layer for data transmission. In this setting, data is forwarded without verification or correction. Consequently, data may vanish during transmission. Furthermore, no flow control is implemented,",

        "provided_answer": "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) refers to a protocol used in Local Area Networks (LANs) for distributing IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on the network.

It's crucial to recognize that DHCP isn't intended to supplant the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), but rather to expand upon it.

This implies adding a time mark to each package and rejecting any package that arrives too late compared to the expected packet arrival time based on the negotiated data transfer rate of the connection.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Broadcasting methods which were previously introduced such as individual sending to every destination and flooding have their own disadvantages. Individual sending wastes bandwidth and requires the sender to know all destinations. Flooding may produce too many duplicates. Broadcast routing like Reverse Path Fowarding and Reverse Path Broadcast can be used to avoid such problems. Specifically, Reverse path broadcast can be used to avoid another problem of Reverse path forwarding, since it forwards packets over suitable edges instead of resend them over all edges. Both algorithms use spanning tree for router initiating broadcast, which is based on a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

A potential weakness of Pure ALOHA is that it has high collision rates due to its uncoordinated nature, which can lead to increased waiting times for data transmission and decreased overall throughput.

On the one hand the MAC should be affordable and also able to deal with higher load, on the other hand it should be expandable for further use. In my opinion I would recommend to use CSMA/CD. Not only because it is most widely spread but also costs efficient which fits one of our prerequisites. Furthermore, CSMA/CD is also easier to expand in comparison with e.g. Token Ring. This fulfills our needs as well. One potential issue using CSMA/CD is that collision increases if utilization increases, this will lead to poor throughput during high utilization periods.",

He claims that under appropriate but soft conditions, a large number of multiplexed flows approach a Poisson process as the number of flows grows.

The main differences lie in their packet sizes and the fields they contain. In the case of UDP, the packet size is fixed at 8 bytes, whereas TCP packets can range from 20 to 60 bytes. This difference arises from the fact that UDP does not include some fields present in TCP, such as the sequence and acknowledgment numbers. On the other hand, TCP has optional fields, including the sender port, which UDP does not have. Another key difference is that UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning it does not establish a dedicated connection before sending data, unlike TCP which is a connection-oriented protocol. Overall, these differences make UDP more suitable for applications that require low latency and real-time data transmission, such as video streaming or online gaming, while TCP is better suited for applications that require\"\n\nRephrased answer: The internet communication is facilitated through two distinct protocols, TCP and UDP. Though they share a commonality in the form of headers, there exist substantial disparities between them. The primary divergences manifest in their packet dimensions and the constituent elements they accommodate. For UDP, the packet size remains constant at 8 bytes, whereas TCP packets fluctuate between 20 to 60 bytes. The reason behind this discrepancy stems from the absence of specific features in UDP, such as sequence and acknowledgment numbers, contrasting TCP's composition. Additionally, TCP offers optional features, such as the sender port number, which UDP does not incorporate. Another notable disparity is that UDP functions as a stateless protocol, eschewing the creation of a dedicated connection prior to data transmission, whereas TCP operates as a stateful protocol, necessitating the establishment of a connection before transferring information.

Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",
        "provided_answer": "Considering the network setup described, I would suggest using Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for encoding bitstreams. First, RLE is known for its excellent compression capabilities, especially when dealing with sequences of repeated data, which is common in network traffic. Second, since all users have perfect clocks, there won't be any significant delay or jitter in the network, making it easier for RLE to maintain the correct sequence of data. However, this recommendation might not be the most optimal choice in terms of bandwidth efficiency compared to Binary Encoding. Nevertheless, it could be a viable option depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the network.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The proposed network configuration suggests employing Run-Length Encoding (RLE) as the encoding method for bitstreams. Given its exceptional compression performance when handling data with continuous repetition, which is prevalent in network transmission, RLE merits serious consideration. Additionally, because all connected devices possess synchronized clocks, network latency and inconsistencies are minimized, thus making it simpler for RLE to retain the proper data sequence. Despite the potential loss in bandwidth efficiency when compared to Binary Encoding, RLE remains a suitable contender for encoding in networks where precise data sequencing is essential.",

You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue.

Consequently, to determine the duration of time the system spends below the 10-packet threshold, we'll first establish the proportion of time it spends at this threshold, then subtract it from 100%, and finally, multiply the resultant value by the 60-second observation window. Let's represent this proportion as P10. The Erlang C formula can help us calculate P10:\n\nP10 = ((lambda^N * rho^2) / (N! * sum from k=0 to N of (lambda^k * rho^k / k!)))^2\n\nIn which lambda symbolizes the arrival rate, and rho represents the server's utilization ratio.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming that packet arrivals in real internet traffic follow a Poisson process might be an oversimplification, but it is still a reasonable approximation. Though packets may appear in bursts, they can also be evenly spaced out. Therefore, it's plausible to consider arrivals as independent events within a small time window, especially when dealing with large datasets. For example, in a study analyzing traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources. However, it is important to remember that this assumption may not hold true in all cases, and more complex models, like Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be required to capture the nuances of real-world internet traffic.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of internet traffic analysis, the assumption that packet arrivals adhere to a Poisson process is commonly used, even though it might be an oversimplification. The reason for this is that packets can exhibit both bursty and evenly spaced behaviors. Nonetheless, assuming that arrivals are independent events within a brief timeframe can be a practical choice, particularly when dealing with extensive data sets. For instance, employing this assumption in a research project investigating traffic patterns on a vast network could result in enhanced precision and conserved computational energy. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be aware that this assumption may not apply universally, and sophisticated models, such as Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be necessary to account for the intricacies of actual internet traffic.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces challenges that are quite different from routing in wired networks. Two major difficulties are as follows.\n\nFirst, mobile routing needs to adapt to the mobility of the nodes. This can be particularly challenging as nodes can move unpredictably and without warning. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of the nodes. For example, if two nodes are communicating and one moves, a new path must be established quickly to maintain the connection.\n\nSecond, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks compared to wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure the security of the network. One common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect the data.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the answer provided above is not factually incorrect, but it does not capture\"\n\nRevised answer: \"The realm of mobile routing presents unique hurdles unlike those encountered in wired networks. Two significant obstacles include:\n\nInitially, mobile routing must accommodate the mobility of nodes. This can pose a considerable challenge as nodes can relocate unexpectedly and without prior notice. Consequently, the network's structure shifts frequently due to the nodes' movement. For instance, if two nodes are exchanging data and one node migrates, an alternative route must be found swiftly to preserve the connection.\n\nMoreover, mobile routing is more vulnerable to attacks than wired networks. The susceptibility stems from the wireless signals' ease of interception, making it vital to bolster the network's security. A common threat is packet interception, where attackers can pilfer confidential data from the network. To counteract this, encryption and authentication are crucial to shield the information.",

You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

We'll denote this rate by the symbol \u03bb. With a time unit T set to 1 second, the probability of having less than 10 packets in the buffer can be determined using the Poisson distribution formula as the sum of probabilities of having 0 to 9 packets in the buffer, i.e., P(less than 10 packets) = sum(k=0 to 9)[ \u03bb^k * exp(-\u03bb) / k!].

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "provided_answer": "In the data link layer, the asynchronous transmission is characterized by its speed, as it allows transmitting multiple characters at once due to the absence of flag bits. The synchronous transmission, on the other hand, is slower, as it insists on using flag bits to separate each character, making it a more laborious and obsolete method. I think this response is incorrect because it gets the role of starting and stopping inverted flag bits and bits. The reference response indicates that the asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission uses flags (or SYN) to define frames. In this response, it states that the asynchronous transmission does not use flags, but allows transmitting multiple characters at once. This is incorrect. In addition, it states that the asynchronous transmission is faster, while the reference states that it has lower transmission rates due to the need to initiate and stop additional bits. Reformed response: In the data link layer, the synchronous transmission is marked by its efficiency, while the anchron transmission makes the response more effective.",

        "question": "Consider a single server queueing system with a buffer of size 10. Let us assume that 9 packets arrive per second and 10 packets are served per second on an average. Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",
        "provided_answer": "On the basis of the information provided, we can determine the number of seconds that the system passes with less than 10 packets in the queue by calculating the average number of packages in the system. The average number of packages in the system, also known as the utilization rate, is given by the sum of the arrival rate and the service rate, which is 19 packets per second. However, since the buffer size is 10, we know that there can never be more than 10 packages in the system at any given time. Therefore, we can adjust the utilization rate to take into account that the system can only contain 10 packages at a time. This means that the effective utilization rate is actually 9 packages per second, since 1 package is always served and 1 package is always in the buffer. To find the expected time that the system passes with less than 10 packages in the queue, we can use the reexpressed response: \"With the data presented, it is possible to determine the value of the absorption capacity, the value of the absorption capacity can be calculated, we can calculate the measurement value of the measure of the measure of the measure of the measure of the measurement.",

However, a major disadvantage is that timing between the terminals can be difficult to maintain, potentially leading to incorrect identification and deletion of valid packages. Secondly, we can employ a sequence number approach. Here, each package is assigned a unique sequence number, and the terminals keep a record of the sequence numbers they have already received. When a new package arrives, its sequence number is compared to the previously registered number. If a match is found, the package is considered a duplicate and discarded. This method is reliable and effective, as long as a new package becomes compared to the previously registered number.",

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are two crucial techniques used in the networking world for data dissemination. They function by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the reverse direction of their normal data flow. This way, they help to minimize the chances of packet duplication in the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding operates by having each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from sender, S, through neighbor, N, it checks its routing table to see if it would forward packets to S through N. If so, it will only forward the packet to all other adjacent nodes except for N. This is based on the assumption that the packet took the optimal route until then.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting involves nodes monitoring unicast traffic to determine which paths they are a part of in the network.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals: Two nodes that reach out to a third node but cannot hear each other are prone to collisions at the receiving node, because both of them sense a free medium. To mitigate the collisions, the receiver e.g. could send a busy tone on a separate frequency to signal all other nodes in range that another node is sending to it, thus avoiding any collisions. Exposed Terminals: A node A in range of another node B is affected by its \"medium in use\" signal.

        "provided_answer": "When we increase the speed of the network from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s using CSMA/CD, the diameter of the collision domain does not change. The reason is that the diameter is not directly related to the speed of the network, but rather to the number of nodes in a segment and their physical distance. Therefore, the decrease in the time taken to transfer data does not affect the diameter. This misconception arises due to the common assumption that the fastest networks automatically equal smaller collision domains, but actually depends on several factors, including the topology and distribution of nodes.\" Reformulated answer: The diameter of the collision domain in a CSMA/CD network remains unchanged when the network speed is updated from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s. This is because the diameter is not determined by the speed of the network, but by the number of nodes in a segment and the distance between them.

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they ensure all nodes are connected while minimizing the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet forwarding.\n\nHowever, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to construct a spanning tree tailored for multicast groups. The key difference is that each node must be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link state packet, enabling each node to construct multicast trees once the network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the entire network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission, enabling packets to be forwarded only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and enhancing overall network performance.",

This growth stems from the heightened occurrence of collisions at swifter speeds, as data packets journey faster through the network, escalating the probability of two devices transmitting concurrently and inducing a clash.

He claims that under appropriate but smooth conditions, a large number of multiplexed flows approach a Poisson process as the number of flows grows.

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The property is that all ES knows the multicast tree. To build an extension tree for multicasting, you also need to add the information from the other IS of the multicast group.\"Reformulated answer: To build an extension tree for multicasting in an Internet service provider network (ISP), it is essential that all participating IS be aware of the multicast structure. In addition to this, the information from other IS in the multicast group must also be incorporated into the tree building process.",

        "reference_answer": "Slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nIn the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged.

Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

In the loss recovery stage, the congestion window (cwnd) is quickly increased to compensate for the lost packets, while in the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid further packet loss. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with every acknowledgement, leading to an exponential growth. Conversely, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half every time a packet is lost. These adaptations help to balance the network traffic and maintain a stable connection.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminal: If multiple nodes are hidden from each other(i.e. can\u00b4t hear each other), the transmission to a common node in between the two nodes may result in a collision at the receiving node.The hidden nodes may send at the same time as the second sender senses a \"free\" medium (carrier sense fails) and the first sender cannot detect the collision (collision detection fails). Exposed Terminals: Exposed Terminals problem occurs when one node is prevented from sending packets to another other node due to a neighbouring transmitting node. If two nodes can hear each other and try to send to different receivers, which are out of range of eachother, but the transmitters are in each others radio range the transmission of the second sending node fails. The second seconding node will postpone its transmission until it detects the medium is idle again.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "While it is true that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic do not follow a perfect distribution of Poisson, the assumption of independence for arrivals within a given time interval remains valid. The bursts in traffic are due to several factors, such as congestion control, user behavior or application requirements. However, the occurrence of an arrival does not directly affect the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For example, a congested network may cause a delay in packet transmission, but does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval. Therefore, although arrivals are not distributed by Poisson, they may still be considered independent within each time interval.\"Reformulated answer: \"Although the arrivals of traffic packages in the real world deviate from the perfect distribution of Poisson, the assumption of independence between arrivals within a given time period remains intact.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

The average number of packets, N, in the system can be calculated by dividing the utilization by one minus the utilization: N = 0.9 / (1 - 0.9) = 9 packages.

        "reference_answer": "Slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nIn the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

First, nodes' mobility causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss.

        "provided_answer": "Three common methods for handling duplicate packages in the transport layer in a connection-oriented service are as follows: First, we have the Time-Stamp approach. In this method, each package is given a unique time stamp, which is only valid for that specific connection. This ensures that packages with the same sequence number, but different time stamps, are treated as duplicates and discarded. One advantage of this method is that it is relatively simple to implement, as it only requires a clock and a certain memory to store time stamps. However, one disadvantage is that it can lead to an increase in processing above due to the need to maintain and compare time stamps for each package. Second, there is the Checksum approach. In this method, each package is checked for errors using a cyclic redundancy control (CRC) or similar algorithm. If a package is received with an incorrect check sum, it is considered a duplicate and discarded.",

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

This is because every packet is sent out separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packets.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are two crucial techniques used in the network world for data dissemination. They work by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the inverse direction of their normal data stream. In this way, they help minimize the possibilities of duplicating packets in the network. Reverse Path Forwarding operates by making each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from the sender, S, through neighbor, N, checks its routing table to see if it would send packets to S through N. If so, it will only send the package to all adjacent nodes except N. This is based on the assumption that the package took the optimal route until then. On the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcast involves nodes monitoring unicat traffic to determine which routes form part of the network.",

The reason is that the diameter is not directly related to the network speed, but rather to the number of nodes in a segment and their physical distance. So, the decrease in time it takes to transfer data does not affect the diameter. This misconception arises due to the common assumption that faster networks automatically equate to smaller collision domains, but in reality, it depends on various factors including topology and node distribution.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The collision domain diameter in a CSMA/CD network remains unaltered when the network speed is upgraded from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s. This is because the diameter is determined not by the network speed, but by the number of nodes in a segment and the distance between them. As a result, the reduction in data transfer time does not impact the diameter.

Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces very different challenges from routing in wired networks. Two major difficulties are the following. First, mobile routing needs to adapt to node mobility. This can be particularly difficult as nodes can move unpredictablely and without prior notice. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of nodes. For example, if two nodes communicate and one moves, a new route must be established quickly to maintain the connection. Second, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks than wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure network security. A common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect data.",

        "provided_answer": "Yes, this strategy would have the problem of oscillation. For example, if we assume that the traffic goes through the CF path, this means that this path is heavily loaded and has high delays. Since the waiting time for the calculation of the shortest path is included in the weighting, connection EI now appears more attractive. New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad. A consequence of this is that the routing tables fluctuate strongly and this leads to erratic routing (instability), which is a big problem for the receiving side (packet loss/wrong packet order/additional overhead).",

UDP, being a connectionless protocol, has a much simpler header structure than TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol.

While UDP has a fixed header length, TCP headers can vary in length due to the inclusion of additional fields such as the sequence number, acknowledgment number, and reserved space. However, I must admit that I was mistaken when I assumed the UDP header did not contain a packet length field.

In this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. Again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports.

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals: In mobile communication, one challenge is, that several nodes cant hear each other. Therefore if two Nodes that can't hear each other communicate with a third node both can reach a collision at this third node can occur. Further, the first two nodes cannot sense the collision and thus the communication is very unreliable, in addition to the waste of resources that always comes with collisions. This problem can be avoided if the third Node sends a \"busy tone\" to the first two nodes if it receives data by one of those nodes and therefore the other one keeps silent. However, a separate channel for the busy tones is needed. Exposed Terminals: Example with the four Terminals: A B C D. Each terminal reaches only its neighbours. If B sends data to A and C wants to send data to D, C can sense the transmission of B and A and therefore has to wait, even though A is outside the range of C and therefore a collision would not occur. This leads to underutilisation of the channel and therefore a lower effective throughput.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the case of the internet, packet arrivals are indeed independent. This is because every packet is sent out separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packets. While it is true that real-world internet traffic can exhibit bursts, this does not mean that packet arrivals are not independent. Instead, it suggests that the distribution of packet arrivals may be non-Poissonian, but the actual arrivals remain independent events.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The independence of packet arrivals in the context of the internet should not be underestimated. Each packet is dispatched individually from its origin and holds no bearing on the delivery of subsequent packets. Although there might be occurrences of traffic bursts in real life internet usage, it does not negate the fact that the independence of packet arrivals persists. What this indicates is that the pattern of packet arrivals might deviate from a Poisson distribution, yet the occurrence of each packet's arrival is an independent event.",

The main disadvantage of extension headers in IPv6 is that they add unnecessary complexity to the header structure, which leads to possible delays in processing. This response is incorrect because extension headers in IPv6 are effectively found between the IPv6 header and the payload header or top or transport layer header, not after the payload.

        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and  Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) are techniques used for Multi- and Broadcast communication. Their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each IS can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   In Reverse Path Forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. If a unicast packet from A to C passes a router B frequently, B knows that it is on the shortest path from A to C and reverse. If, on the other hand, a router D never sees any unicast packets from A to C, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. This information is then used when a flooding packet from A or C (sender) arrives at either C or D (IS). Only if the IS is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   Reverse Path Broadcasting is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. Not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the IS entry port, where it received the multicast packets like RPF does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. In contrast to RPF, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, RPB attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. Namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

In addition, the sender must attach the Ack to the data itself.\" Reformulated answer: The protocol of the sliding window incorporates the cerkbacking, where the receiver does not send an acknowledgement of receipt until it is prepared to send the next one. This means waiting a specific time to add the sequence number and the next ACK sequence number to the next data frame. To do this, account must be taken of the additional time latency and notify the sender that independent ACK frames cannot be transmitted.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

The additional bytes of the TCP header length are for the Sequence Number, Acknowledge Number, HL/RESV/Flags, Advertised Win, Urgent Pointer and the options. This additional information cannot be found in the UDP header, in particular there is no possibility for options besides the compulsory function of the header.

        "provided_answer": "There are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. Two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * Hidden Terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. As an example, we can imagine that station A and C does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station B in the middle. So A and C both try to transmit data to C, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * Exposed Terminals: A problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. We can easily imagine a situation, where the stations B and C are in close proximity to each other, but where C cannot see B\u2019s partner A and B cannot detect C\u2019s partner D.  If B wants to send data to A, which is not visible to C, C has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner D is also blocked by B\u2019s communication. In reality, C could send parallel to B, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. So we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * Inherent Heterogenity: As mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. Therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * Dynamic Source Routing: Due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in \u201cnormal\u201d networks. So one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based Dynamic Source Routing in reactive routing protocols.",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "An important property of spanning trees is that spanning trees do not have any cycles. Adding any edge to the tree will result in a cycle. So, a spanning tree is maximally acyclic. They are all minimally connected. That means that the spanning tree will no longer be connected if one edge is eliminated. The spanning tree algorithm ensures that there are no undesirably rotating packets. It identifies multiple paths by converting topologies with redundant paths by logically blocking certain paths into a tree topology with no loops. All but one connection is blocked on the switches with multiple connections to other switches. To construct a spanning tree for multicasting out of a link-state routing, each IS knows which group it belongs to but doesn't know which other IS belongs to the group as well. The IS sends packets that contain the distance to neighbors and the information on which multicast group it belongs to. The packet is sent by broadcast to all other nodes.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

This is accomplished by propagating reverse pointers throughout the network, allowing each node to maintain an up-to-date reverse mapping of its neighbors.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding: When a node receives a packet from a neighbor, it checks its routing table to determine the best path back to the packet's source. It then forwards the packet along all outgoing links except the one it received the packet on, ensuring that each link is traversed only once.\n\nReverse Path Broadcasting: This mechanism relies on nodes actively listening to and recording unicast traffic as it passes through them. By maintaining a record of which paths are used by unicast traffic, each node can determine which spanning trees it is a part of\"\n\nRephrased answer: Nodes in a network employ Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting to remain aware of other nodes and their connectivity. Reverse pointers are disseminated through the network, enabling each node to maintain a current reverse mapping of its neighbors.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding: Upon receiving a packet from a neighbor, a node examines its routing table to ascertain the optimal route to the packet's origin. Subsequently, it forwards the packet via all of its outgoing connections, except the one that received the packet, thereby preventing any loop.\n\nReverse Path Broadcasting: This technique involves nodes monitoring and documenting unicast traffic that passes through them.

Prior to being sent, a distinctive checksum is appended to every packet. Upon receipt, the receiving end calculates the checksum and contrasts it with the one appended by the sender. If the checksums correspond, the packet is deemed authentic and is permitted access. If not, the packet is eliminated.\n\nBenefits:\n1. This method's implementation is uncomplicated, as it necessitates merely the attachment of a checksum to each packet.\n2.

After this, the protocol moves to the congestion avoidance phase, which implies that the cwnd expands according to the number of segments received. The threshold remains unchanged during this phase.

        "provided_answer": "Mobile Routing has different challenges, since communication does not happen on a wired medium and is therefore broadcast by nature.  1. Hidden Terminals: If two nodes, A and C, can't hear each other due to their distance, and there is a node B located in the intersection of their transmission, their transmissions can collide at node B without A and C noticing it. CSMA/CD does not work here, since A and C will not hear each other and can therefore not detect a collision.   2. Exposed terminal problem: Station B transmits to station A at the same time C wants to transmit to D. If C senses the medium. it will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to D, but it\u2019s unnecessary because these two transmissions don\u2019t interfere each other.

        "question": "WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. If they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. By doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The property of spanning trees that makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting is their ability to minimize the total distance between all nodes in the network. This is achieved by selecting the shortest possible path between every pair of nodes in the tree, ensuring efficient packet forwarding.\n\nTo modify Link State Routing (LSR) for multicasting, we can introduce a multicast metric that each node uses to calculate the shortest path to the multicast tree root. Each node will then distribute this metric along with the regular link state information. This way, all nodes in the network can build the multicast tree based on the shortest path to the root, ensuring efficient multicast group communication.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"What makes spanning trees an attractive choice for both broadcasting and multicasting in networks is their ability to minimize the overall distance among all connected nodes. This is accomplished by selecting the most succinct path between every pair of nodes within the tree, thus facilitating effective packet relaying.\n\nTo transform Link State Routing (LSR) into a multicast-capable protocol, one approach is to introduce a multicast metric for every node to determine the shortest path to the multicast tree root. Subsequently, these multicast metrics will be disseminated alongside the standard link state information. Consequently, every node in the network can establish the multicast tree based on the shortest path to the root, thereby ensuring proficient multicast group communication.",

Advantage: An advantage of the bursting of frames over the carrier extension is that it reduces the number of control messages sent during transmission, resulting in less overload and better performance. Disadvantage: However, the bursting of frames may also lead to further delay due to the need to wait for multiple frames to accumulate before transmitting them in an explosion, which may negatively affect the system's response capacity.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the context of modeling packet arrivals as a poisson process, the assumption that arrivals for each time interval are independent is a fundamental one. This holds true for real internet traffic as well. In fact, the very nature of a poisson process implies that each arrival is a random event occurring with a constant rate, and that there is no correlation between arrivals. It's important to remember that while real internet traffic may exhibit bursts, these bursts are simply a result of varying rates and not a violation of the independence assumption. In essence, the arrival process is still a random one, which makes the independence assumption valid.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"The key assumption underlying the use of a Poisson process to model packet arrivals is the independence of arrivals for each time interval. This principle applies not only to simulated traffic but also to real-world internet traffic. The essence of a Poisson process lies in the fact that each arrival is an isolated, random event with a consistent arrival rate, with no connection to previous or subsequent arrivals. While real-world internet traffic can display bursts, these bursts do not constitute a breach of the assumption of independence. Instead, they can be attributed to fluctuating rates and are still an expression of the random nature of the arrival process.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The duration of data packets to travel from source to destination is much longer in mobile networks due to changes in wireless and frequent media topology. This delay may negatively affect the user experience and overall network performance. 2.Cost: The implementation and maintenance of mobile routing infrastructure may be significantly more expensive compared to wired networks. This is due to the need for additional components such as batteries, antennas and processing units to ensure reliable connectivity and manage the dynamic character of mobile networks. Despite these errors, the student\u2019s response seems consistent and related to the question. The wrong challenges, latency and cost, are plausible challenges in mobile networks, but are not the main challenges discussed in the reference response.

See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Challenges of Mobile Routing as compared to routing in fixed and wired networks: * Dynamic Topology: changes in topology are more common and frequent for mobile networks. And routing protocols in fixed and wired networks create routing tables independent of demand which can be very costly in Mobile Routing. * Power and Bandwidth: Mobile devices have limited battery and bandwidth available to them and hence routing algorithms need to be extremely efficient and use as little of both as possible. * Security: Mobile networks have a wider range of security threats than wired networks. Nodes can join the network if they are in range and attacks like DOS are easy to perform. There is no boundary between the inside network and the outside world. The unpredictable and dynamic topology means that no safe routes can be established and reused. For eg: Black hole attacks.

        "provided_answer": "When we increase the speed of a network using CSMA / CD from 10Mb / s to 100Mb / s, the collision domain diameter actually increases. This is because the faster data travels, the further it can potentially reach before a collision occurs. As a result, the area covered by the collision domain expands, leading to a larger diameter. However, it's important to note that this is not always the case, as other factors like network topology and device placement can also impact the collision domain diameter. But in general, an increase in network speed tends to result in a larger collision domain diameter, counterintuitively.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The enlargement of the network speed from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s via CSMA/CD results in a broader collision domain diameter. This is because faster data transmission allows data to potentially reach a greater distance before a collision takes place. Consequently, the collision domain's coverage area expands, leading to an increased diameter. Nonetheless, it's crucial to remember that this isn't a universal truth, as factors such as network topology and device placement can also influence the collision domain diameter.

How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

As a next step, we can then calculate the change rate of the queue to \u03c1 = \u019b/\u03bc = 0.9. What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-\u03c1)\u03c1^n)/(1-\u03c1^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes via a single path. However, building an extension tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known by all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link status package as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node should first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through other media, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can build a multicast tree that spans several elements using algorithms such as OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can manage the distribution of group membership information along with network topology.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "reference_answer": "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used in Internet Protocol (IP) networks, whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network. Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information  (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)",
        "provided_answer": "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a communication protocol utilized in local area networks (LANs) to automatically assign IP addresses and other relevant network configurations to devices on demand. Unlike Static Host Configuration Protocol (SHCP), DHCP eliminates the need for manual IP address allocation.\n\nHowever, my understanding of DHCP's functionality might be misconstrued. I was under the impression that it was used exclusively in Wide Area Networks (WANs) and not Local Area Networks (LANs). I believe that DHCP's primary purpose is to streamline the configuration process and simplify network management by automatically providing devices with the necessary network settings.\n\nDespite my confusion, it appears that DHCP has been widely adopted in place of the older Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) due to its versatility and ease of use. This,\"\n\nRephrased answer: In local area networks (LANs), the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) operates as a communication protocol that automatically distributes IP addresses and related network configurations to devices as required, rendering manual IP address allocation redundant, unlike the Static Host Configuration Protocol (SHCP).\n\nHowever, my comprehension of DHCP's functionality may not be entirely accurate. I had thought it to be solely applicable to Wide Area Networks (WANs) instead of LANs. My assumption was that its main role was to expedite the configuration process and reduce network management complexity by automatically supplying devices with the necessary network settings.\n\nDespite my misunderstanding, it seems that DHCP has gained significant traction in the market and surpassed the usage of older protocols such as the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) due to its adaptability",

Additionally, during the data transfer there is no real connection between sender and recipient. The data units are transmitted isolated in only one direction as an answer to the data request. \n\n2.\t\u201eConfirmed Connectionless Service\u201c\nCompared to the first, within the second service class the receiver will let the sender know about the successful transmission of the data. If there is no acknowledgement from the recipient within a certain time frame, the data units will be send again. So there will not be any loss of data. \nBut because of the retransmission there might be duplicates and sequence errors.\nFuthermore, this means there is no flow control as in the first service class and also no real connection between sender and receiver.

        "provided_answer": "UDP and TCP are two different communication protocols used to send data packets over the Internet. The main difference between their headers lies in their length and the information they carry. UDP headers are shorter, usually 4 bytes, compared to TCP headers, which can vary from 8 to 20 bytes. Another significant difference is the fields they include. While UDP headers only have port numbers of origin and destination, TCP headers contain additional information such as sequence number, recognition number and flags to manage data transmission. In addition, UDP packets do not have a header/data compensation field, but include the entire package length (data + header) within their headers. In contrast, TCP headers have a header/data compensation field, which only specifies the header length and not the entire package length. In addition, the sender port is optional in UDP but mandatory in TCP to establish connections.",

        "provided_answer": "IPv6 was designed to support only a few thousand devices at a time. This was a major improvement on IPv4, which could only handle a few hundred. Another goal of IPv6 was to make routing tables longer and more complex. This was necessary to accommodate the larger address space. In addition, IPv6 simplified protocol processing with a more complicated header structure. This made it easier for developers to write code as they did not have to worry about the complexities of IPv4 headers. Finally, IPv6 did not prioritize security at all, as it was believed that security could be added later through additional protocols. However, it turns out that the lack of IPv6 built-in security features made it a major target for hackers, and security became a major concern after deployment.",

Typically the network is often congested as all users generate more traffic than the link\u2019s capacities. Which of the encoding techniques introduced in the lecture should be used in this network to encode bitstreams? Give two reasons for your answer in 2-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",
        "provided_answer": "Considering the network has 3 users, Differential Encoding is the best option. First, it allows for error correction by comparing the difference between the current and previous bits. This is essential as the network is often congested, leading to bit errors. Second, since users have perfect clocks, they can easily maintain a common reference frame for decoding the differential encoded bitstreams. This eliminates the need for clock synchronization protocols, thereby reducing latency and improving overall network efficiency. However, it is important to note that Differential Encoding may not be the most bandwidth-efficient encoding technique, but it offers robustness and synchronization benefits in this scenario.",

        "provided_answer": "Frame bursting refers to the technique of breaking down large frames into smaller ones for easier transmission. This method is opposite to frame aggregation, where several frames are combined into one large frame. A major disadvantage of frame bursting is that it requires more control signaling, making it less efficient than carrier extension. Additionally, there's an increased risk of errors due to the larger number of frames in transit. However, an advantage of frame bursting is that it can provide a smoother data flow, as the smaller frames are less susceptible to congestion and packet loss compared to large frames. This can be beneficial in networks with varying traffic conditions or where real-time data is being transmitted.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The concept of frame bursting entails splitting up expansive frames into smaller ones for facilitated transmission. Contrastingly, frame aggregation amalgamates multiple frames into one larger frame. One limitation of frame bursting lies in its higher demand for control signaling, leading to reduced efficiency compared to carrier extension. Moreover, there's an enhanced risk of errors since a greater quantity of frames is in transit. Nevertheless, frame bursting presents a perk in the form of a more continuous data flow, as smaller frames are less vulnerable to congestion and packet loss as compared to extensive frames. This can be advantageous in networks featuring fluctuating traffic patterns or when real-time data is being conveyed.",

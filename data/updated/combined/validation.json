It is particularly used in applications where a high error rate is expected, such as for moving devices. Similar to the unconfirmed connectionless service, no flow control or a connect/disconnect phase takes place.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

So when A sends to B due to the fact that C can't receive A C senses B as \"free\" medium and also sends to B. Then at B a collision occurs which A can't detect. A is therefore \"hidden\" for C and C for A. Another challenge are \"exposed terminals\". There we have 4 nodes A, B, C and D. A can reach B, B can reach A and C, C can reach B and D and D can reach C. Now B sends to A and C wants to send to D. But because C signals a medium in use it has to wait, even if the medium in use is  B sending to A and A is outside the radio range of C and the waiting is not necessary. So C is \"exposed\" to B. The third challenge are \"near and far terminals\" which is about 3 terminals A, B and C where A and B are sending and C is receiving.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are both broadcast algorithms that attempt to minimize the number of duplicates packets in the network compared to other algorithms like the simple Flooding algorithm. The idea of Reverse Path Forwarding is that each sender/node has an own spanning tree, but the other ISs do not need to know them. The algorithm is based on a simple condition for each node. The node has to decide, whether the received packet sent over the best route, i.e. it used the edge the node would use to send it back to the sender/author or not. If this is true, the node resends this packet over all other edges, i.e. excluding the incoming one, otherwise, the packet is most likely a duplicate and it will be discarded. The Reverse Path Broadcast goes a little further and the IS sends the packet from the best route only to the nodes it is responsible for/the sender used before. If the IS is on the best path between the sender and his neighbor node, i.e. it is responsible for it, it learns over time.",

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "In mobile communication, nodes can move, i.e. are not placed on a fixed location, and are transmitting over the air, i.e. they use wireless communication. This stands in big contrast to fixed and wired networks.\n\nTo adapt to these new factors, challenges on many different layers occur. Whether the Discovery of Service in the Application Layer, the specific needs for routing in the Network Layer, or the control of power used for transmission in the Physical Layer and even more have to be taken into account to set up such a mobile network.\n\n             -  For mobile routing, the following challenges exist:\n\n                         o   Hosts can move and change the attachment to a certain network segment (handover). This handover mechanisms occur in cellular networks and in complex WLAN infrastructures as well. For the  example of WLAN, handover can be handled at the link layer if both ace points are in the same networks. If there are different networks, a network layer handoff occurs and needs to be considered to implement routing for a seamless service.\n\n                         o   In mobile ad-hoc networks, nodes can disappear due to the radio system and channel characteristics. Therefore the network topology may change rapidly and pre-calculated, pro-active routing may fail. In this case, reactive routing maybe of preference, as the route is calculated using the actual network topology.\n\n             - Moreover, the general challenges in mobile communication include:\n\n                        o   Hidden terminals\n\n                                \u00a7  Since in mobile communication no wire is used, the nodes can only listen for a certain distance defined by the radio parameters and the channel characteristics, which makes the usage of CSMA/CD not practicable as the concept of Carrier Detection (CD) does not work.\n\n                                    An already happening transmission to a certain destination node could not be detected by an intermediate system (IS) if the node communicating with the destination node is out of the \u201clistening\u201d-range of the IS. To solve this problem the collision will not be \u201cdetected\u201d but \u201cavoided\u201d using certain ACKs (CSMA/CA, RTS/CTS).\n\n                       o   Exposed terminals\n\n                                 \u00a7  When a node wants to send a packet and detects an already existing transmission in its transmission area, it waits until the existing transmission is finished and only thereafter sends its packet to avoid collisions.\n                                     This can cause underutilization of a channel if the receiving nodes are far enough away from each other, i.e. beyond the radio range, and therefore both transmissions would not affect each other and could have successfully be completed in parallel.\n\n                       o  Near and Far terminals\n\n                                  \u00a7  If multiple packets arrive at the receiver, they will typically arrive with different signal strengths. Depending on the modulation used, the receiver will detect the \u201cstronger\u201d packet and ignore the \u201cweaker\u201d packets if the power difference is large enough. However, fading and multipath may lead to changing power levels and add complexity to the problem.\n\n                                  \u00a7  Using a multipath receiver design, both packets can be detected as different paths and the receiver may fail to detect these packets. The near/far problem is difficult to solve in direct sequence spread spectrum systems (rake receivers). In OFDM based system, this problem is less severe.",

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "1. Hidden Terminals: for example there are 3 nodes A, B, C. A cannot hear C and vice versa, and B is located between A and C. B can hear A and C. When A sends to B, C still thinks that B is free, thus start sending to B as well. This results in a collision in B. 2. Near and Far Terminals: assume there are 3 nodes A, B, C. B and C are located near to each other, while A is located farther from them. When both A and B send to C, B's stronger signal drowns A's weaker signal, thus making C cannot hear/receive A.",

        "provided_answer": "One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection. On paper, this reduces the problem of duplicates since each TSAP is only used once and therefore reduces the number of duplicates to the ones occuring in that one connection. However, a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known. Hence, it is not possible to realize this approach and generate temporary TSAPs for each connection.\u00a0\n\nAnother method would be to make connections unique and identify them individually. An advantage is that duplicates from different connections do not occur anymore since each is unique. However, this is not possible with connection-less systems. Additional knowledge is needed to realize this approach since end systems need to remember the sequence numbers even after being turned off so that they remain unique for each connection.\u00a0\n\nThe third approach to solve duplicates is to identify each packet individually with unique sequence numbers. An advantage is that it easily allows the receiver to identify and discard duplicate packets since it can just compare sequence numbers to check if it already received a packet with that number. However, this approach requires that the range of sequence numbers are chosen wisely so that they do not repeat before each packet is delivered and processed.

So there is less time of data frames travelling on the line during which the stations could detect a collision.

Dividing the lambda by \u00b5 gives us the utilization. In the case of an equilibrium in a finite buffer, the probability of having less than 10 packets can be calculated from the formula of the blocking probability (slide 31). As this formula would give us the probability of the system being full, we would then need to subtract it from 1. Finally, this would then be multiplied by 60 (as 1 minute contains 60 seconds) to give the number of seconds in which we expect the system to have less than 10 packets in the queue. The calculated blocking probability is 5,08% and therefore the probability of the system not being blocked 94,92%. 94,92% of 60 seconds is 56,952 seconds which is the estimated time of the system having less than 10 packets in the queue.",

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

During the forwarding process the bridge deciedes based on the information table over which LAN the frame should be routed (In case the source an the destination LAN are the same, the packet can be dropped). If the table does not hold any information about the destination point, it will be flooded.

        "provided_answer": "Reverse path forwarding (RPF) and reverse path broadcast (RPB) are techniques used in routers. They enable loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING:  In this procedure, each node i checks whether an incoming packet from source q has been received on the connection on which node i also transmits its packets to q. If this is the case, then the packet is assumed to have been transmitted on the shortest route and it is forwarded on all other lines. If, on the other hand, a packet was received on a line other than the one on which data is transmitted to the sender, then it is assumed that it is a duplicate that did not take the shortest route. This duplicate is then discarded instead of being forwarded. REVERSE PATH BROADCAST:  RPB is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path with respect to the interface where the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of data to the interface of the router. As a result, multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces where the next router is located in the reverse direction on the shortest path to the data source. RPB specifically checks whether the incoming packet arrives at the IS through which the packets for this station/source are normally also sent.  If not, the packet is discarded directly. If yes, it will be further checked if the packet has taken the best path so far. If yes \u2192 select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) If not \u2192 do not send over all edges (without the incoming one)",

If you just want to send two packets you have to put some additional data or rubbish inside because the frame only will send if the whole frame is filled with data. The higher latency is introduced through the packing/filling of the buffer, depending on the implementation, either the two packages get stuck or transmitted with a higher latency with rubbish frames to fill the buffer.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminal Problem: Having three nodes A, B and C where A and C are in range of B, but not in range of each other, if A and C send at the same time to B, there will be interference at B, but they dont know because they are out of range of each other. Exposed Terminal Problem: The constellation of the Exposed Terminal Problem are two sender-receiver pairs where the senders are in range of each other, but not the receivers. If S1 sends data to R1, S2 will assume that the channel is occupied and cannot send data, while in theory it could because R2 is out of range of S1.",

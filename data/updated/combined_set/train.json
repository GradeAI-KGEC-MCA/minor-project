        "question": "which property of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? explain how you can modify link state routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "property: there is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. this means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nspanning tree with link state routing: each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other is belong to the groups. therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with prim or kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "what makes spanning trees appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they are a subset of the network or group including all nodes but are free of loops. this ensures that forwarding along the branches of a spanning tree will not result in packets being forwarded forever in a loop and that all nodes in the network or group are reached. the link state packets have to be expanded by information on multicast groups which basically is the list of multicast groups an is currently belongs to. this way, each is not only knows the complete network topology, but also the state of every other is, meaning which groups they belong to. by selecting only the is of the same multicast group, an is is able to calculate a multicast tree and use it to determine the outgoing lines on which packets have to be transmitted.",
        "answer_feedback": "the explanation behind using a spanning tree for multicast and broadcast is partially correct because though the network is loop-free, using the tree results in the minimum number of message copies required to be forwarded and not just the prevention of forwarding loops. the explanation for modifying the link-state algorithm to construct a  multicast spanning tree is correct.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "this assumption is not 100% applicable due to the fact, that there are packets which are dependent on each other like tcp packets. in this case, in order to estabilish a tcp connection, pecific packets have to be sent, which are strict dependent on each other. if we have a tcp connection, which starts at time t and ends at time t+n, there are some packets in this time period, which are dependent on each other.",

        "provided_answer": "a spanning tree has no cycles, this is especially useful in broad and multicast as otherwise packets might end up looping in the network forever. to setup a spanning tree for multicasting, all is periodically send link state packets to all other is to update them on their local state. all is can then compute a global spanning tree using the global state of the network that they now have. since the algorithms are deterministic all is will arrive at the same spanning tree that they can then use for multicasting.",

        "provided_answer": "both algorithms try to detect duplicate bundles in programs and only forward bundles that are likely new and need to be forwarded. other bundles are likely duplicates and are discarded.  in reverse course forwarding, each router saves which course a bundle takes from a sender s in a unicast communication, considering it to be the shortest course from s. from there on, program bundles from s that are not coming over that course are considered to be duplicates and are discarded. program bundles from s coming over that course are accepted and programed to all edges except to the incoming one. one disadvantage of rpf is that the bundle is resent over all edges (except the incoming one), but not forwarded only over suitable edges.  in reverse course program, a node also remembers the course taken from a sender s in a unicast communication. additionally, a node also learns that if it never received a unicast bundle from s to another node b, then it is likely not on the shortest course from s to b. to reduce the unnecessary bundle duplication in rpf, the bundle is not forwarded on all edges (except the incoming edge), but only on the edges which are in the reversed direction to source s.",

        "provided_answer": "- reverse path forwarding: the main idea is here is that each sender has its own spanning tree, but the is do not need to know the spanning trees itself. _algorithm:_ 1. node b sends unicast packets to destination node s using the shortest route via the node a 2. node s sends braodcast packets to all nodes which are also forwared by a to b 3. since b also can get the braodcasted packets from other nodes, the unicast routing information is used to determine which information to keep: - if the broadcastet packet from s did not arrive via a, ignore it because we know that the path via a is the shortest route - if the broadcastet packets arrived via a then keep the data because we know its the shortest route - reverse path broadcast:  the main idea here is to just use the edges, in the broadcast step, at which the packets arrived and reroute it to the source instead of broadcasting to all and every nodes. this helps avoiding duplicates. _algorithm:_ 1. node b sends unicast packets to node s via node a. where a inspects the packets and can learn the best path and also the best path in the reversed direction. furthermore, other connected nodes to b can learn that they never did receive a unicast path from b to s, means they are not part of the path.  2. now when s broadcasts the packets, just a fowards the packets to b. the other connected node to b will not forward the packets to b because it knows it is not part of the best route → the connection from that node to b is relieved. the node does foward the broadcast packets from s to other nodes though.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "reference_answer": "property: there is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. this means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nspanning tree with link state routing: each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other is belong to the groups. therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with prim or kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "What makes the trees that extend across a wide and multicasting is that they are a subset of the network or group including all nodes but are loop-free. This ensures that forwarding along the branches of a tree that extends will not result in packages that are forever forwarded in a loop and that all nodes of the network or group are reached. Link status packages have to be expanded by information about multicast groups that is basically the multicast group list to which they currently belong a. in this way, each not only knows the entire network topology, but also the status of each other, that is, to which groups they belong. selecting only the is of the same multicast group, one is able to calculate a multicast tree and use it to determine the output lines on which the packages should be transmitted.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding - for sending unicast packets - if the packet arrived over the usually sent station, we will assumpt that the packet used the best route. now it will resend it over all edges, else the packet will be discarded reverse path broadcast - is like reverse path forwarding, but it won't be resent over all edges. it will select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse route forwarding and reverse route retransmission are routing algorithms that are used for multicast routing scenarios. to adjust to changing topologies use floods to find suitable routes. the principle of reverse route forwarding is that each station has a tree that represents routing to other stations. the packages are flooded from the first shipping station and propagated through the network. when a package is received, each station checks if a package arrives at the port it normally arrives at. if it is assumed that it has used the best route until now and the package is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded. the reverse route retransmission follows a similar approach. it differs in how it handles the packets that are received in the port packets of entry to this destination are normally assumed. there is an additional check, if the package uses the best route until now. if so selects the edge on which unicat packages arrive and from which they are forwarded to the source. otherwise it is not sent over all the edges.",

        "provided_answer": "no. typically users dont use internet services continuesly throughout the whole day (and night), but in relatively short bursts. so this model would not hold over this timescales. another reason is that in reality packages may depend on other packages e.g. with tcp traffic.",
        "answer_feedback": "one can use a function instead of a constant to model the arrival rate to reflect such large-scale behavioral patterns like non-continuous internet use over the day. the arrivals would not depend on previous arrivals then, only on the time of the day, which is known. apart from that, the response is correct.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding is used for loop free broadcasts of multicast packages, while reverse path broadcasting is an improved version of rpf. they work by assigning every sender its own spanning tree, while the is does not have to know them. if a node gets a package from a link that it knows from its spanning tree is the best possible route to it, it resends it on every other port, if it gets a package on a port, that it knows is not the best route it discards it. rpb on the other hand improves this algorithm in a way that it looks at the package, if it always took the best route, not only if it arrived at the best port. this way far less packets get resend, which reduces the traffic on the network.",
        "answer_feedback": "the purpose is not limited to multicast but also used in broadcast. in rpf, a node decides whether the packet used the best route so far based on its routing table consisting of unicast information, not from the spanning tree. in rpb, is only forward packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree, which is not clear from the explanation.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent ip address spoofing in unicast routing. network administrators can use unicast reverse path forwarding (unicast rpf) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. this security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. the principle of rpf is each sender has its own spanning tree but is does not need to know the spanning trees. each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. algorithm of rpf is as below: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? yes: assumption: packet used the best route until now action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) no: assumption: packet did not use this route (it is not the best route) action: discard packet (most likely duplicate reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. trpb routing is an extension of rpb routing. it ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. the principle of rpb is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. a router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. the algorithm of rpb is as below: has this packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this station/source s are usually also sent?  yes: packet used the best route until now?   yes: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s (in reversed direction)  no: do not send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in reverse path forwarding (rpf)  no: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "rpf and rpb are algorithms used to reduce the number of duplicate and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths. in rpf, if an is receives a packet from a source over which it would normally receive unicast packets, it can assume the packet has taken the optimal path so far, and it forwards it over all outbound edges.  if it did not come over the port unicast packets normally would, then the is discards the packet. in rpb, only specific outgoing ports are selected rather than all ports.  if an is receives a packet from a source that it would normally receive packets from, it will only forward the packets on the outgoing ports for which it is on the optimal path from source to destination, rather than forwarding on all outgoing ports as in rpf.  the is knows whether it is on the optimal path by inspecting unicast packets.  if the packet did not come on a port from which the is would normally receive packets, then the is can discard the message (as in rpf).",
        "answer_feedback": "the response incorrectly states that \"if an is receives a packet from a source over which it would normally 'receive' unicast packets\". instead, it should be \"if an is receives a packet from sender s over neighbor n and would usually send packets to s over n\". the same holds for rpb. also, both rpf and rpb exclude the link from which it receives the packet.",

        "provided_answer": "the spanning tree is a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. this leads to a generation of a minimum number of packet copies. link state routing can be modified by expanding the contained information of the periodically send link state packets with information on multicast groups. because these link state packets are broadcasted to all the other is, each is can calculate a multicast tree from the now locally available and complete state information. based on the information about the multicast tree the is determines the outgoing lines on which the packets have to be retransmitted.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "provided_answer": "We can therefore use this structure to transmit a package in all directions from which we did not receive the package and finally each node will receive the package once only. the multicast basic principle implies that everything must know the multicast tree. for the status of the routing link everything is sending link state packets, containing important information, periodically broadcasting to all others.

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",

        "question": "what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding is that the intermediate systems (is) do not need to know the spanning trees. instead, each sender has its own spanning tree. when a packet arrives at an is it checks whether this packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this sender are usually also sent, meaning that no other packet from the same sender arriving at the is has used a better route so far. if this is the case, the incoming packet is forwarded over all edges except from the incoming one. if not, the packet gets discarded since it is not using the best route and most likely is a duplicate. the purpose of reverse path broadcast is to prevent the resending over all edges as it is the case with reverse path forwarding and instead only forward the packets over suitable edges. when a packet arrives at an is, it also checks whether the packet used the best route until now like above. the difference is that in this case only the edge, at which the packets which are rerouted to the sender, arrive, is selected for forwarding the incoming packet. key point is that path information gained by inspecting unicast packets is leveraged at each is to prevent unnecessary transmissions.",

        "provided_answer": "this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic, since when we are watching a video, for example, we want to receive the packets, so we want the probability a packet to be delivered to be 1 and not 0. if we are not watching we want the probability to be 0. and a part from this when we are watching a video, we get a bunch of packets, then there is a higher probability that we receive also the next packets.",

        "question": "what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast are broadcast routing algorithms. the purpose of them is that sending a packet to all destinations simultaneously while making full use of bandwidth and do not waste resources. 1. reverse pah forwarding when a broadcast packet arrives at a router, the router checks to see if the packet arrived on the line that is normally used for sending packets from source to destination. if so, the very broadcast packet used the best route until now and is therefore resend over all edges. if not, i.e. the packet did not use such route, it will be discarded like duplicate. 2. reverse path broadcast when a packet arrives at the intermediate system, is checks to see if the packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this souces s are usually sent. if so then it continues checking to see if the packet used the best route until now. if this nested-if holds true, then select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are rerouted to source s. if it holds false, then do not send over all edges. otherwise, the arrived packet will be discarded as a likely duplicate.",
        "answer_feedback": "the stated purpose is incorrect as the response is not explicit about which resources and how their wastage is avoided. the explanation for rfb and rpb is correct except that in both algorithms, the packet is also not forwarded to the edge from which it was received.",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding (rpf) is the prevention of loops in a network when a multicast is sent from a node. it works in the way that each node has the knowledge about which node it would use for sending a unicast packet due to unicast routing algorithms. when a multicast packet arrives at a node’s entry port, the node would forward the packet to all other nodes (except for the one where the packet arrived) only if the node would also use this very node for sending the incoming packets to its source. otherwise, the packet is discarded because it is most likely a duplicate. the purpose of reverse path broadcast is to send a broadcast over the network without the occurrence of loops. it works in a similar way like rpf but here, a receiving node doesn’t forward the packet to all other nodes. a receiving node instead only forwards the packet to the node it would also send a unicast packet to.",

        "original_answer": "the purpose of rpf and rpb is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). in reverse path forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. they will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. every receiving node has to \"ask itself the question\": has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? if the answer is yes, it will assume that the received packets used the best route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. reverse path broadcast is a more complex version of rpf. in this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. every time a node receives packets it will have to \"ask itself\" two questions. first \"has this packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? if the answer is no, the packets will be discarded. otherwise it will \"ask itself\" the next question. \"have the packets used the best route until now?\" if the answer is yes the node will send the packets onto an edge. this edge lies on the best route from the destination node to the source node. otherwise the packets will be discarded.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "the fish process that is used to model packet arrivals is not very realistic for real Internet traffic. if packet arrivals are considered for a longer period (through day and night, or through before and after the black Friday period, ...), there will certainly be some intervals with a lot of sequels (on the 1st day or during the black Friday promotion) or a lot of sequels (on the 1st day or before and after the promotion). the other scenario could be possible when considering the arrivals of video transmission packages, with the help of the streaming buffer, the package will arrive continuously for a period of time (when the sequence player prefetches the data and stores them in his own buffer).

        "reference_answer": "since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds",
        "provided_answer": "1. calculate the blocking probability for an m/m/1/10 model using the formula ((1-p)*p^n)/(1-p^(n+1)) with p=λ/µ=9/10 and n=10\n\n2. subtract this probability from one in order to get the probability that the system is not full, so there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue\n\n3. multiply the last probability with 60 seconds\n\n4. the result is 0.949 * 60s = 56.94s, which is the expected number of seconds for the system being in a state with less than 10 packets waiting in the queue if the system is monitored for one minute after equilibrium has been reached",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, this assumption is too strong for real internet traffic. the probability that you get another packet after you received one is much higher as e.g. video applications might fetch the next seconds of the video into the local buffer which causes a number of packets. after buffering a segment of the video, there is no traffic until the next video segment is fetched which again causes more traffic. furthermore, circumstances like the time of the day influence the traffic in different ways.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. they enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. if this is the case, no forwarding takes place to avoid loops. reverse path forwarding (also called reverse path flooding) (rpf) is a variation of the method spanning tree. each sender has its spanning tree. the other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. the assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  the rpf algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. if yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. if not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. this duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. the significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. if a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. as soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. the disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. the reverse path broadcast (rpb) is like rpf but with a specific selection of outgoing links. after the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. if yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s. if not, it won't send over all edges. reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",

        "provided_answer": "spanning trees are interesting for broad- and multicasting because they represent a subset of a graph that contains all nodes but no loops. if every router in the network knows about the structure of the spanning tree, it can simply forward a received broadcast to the remaining spanning tree lines without creating duplicates or not using the bandwidth optimally. in the link state algorithm all stations have information about the existing other stations and can create a model of the topology by themselves. this model can then be used to create a spanning tree that fulfills the advantages mentioned above.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no because in the model the packet arrivals have a probability to receive or not to receive a packet. for example, overnight no packets have to be received and delta(t) must be all the time 0. and while streaming a movie multiple packets have to be received and delta(t) must be 1 all the time. additionally, for movies, packets get receive via a stream buffer with more packets in a row and so the arrivals are not independent.",

        "provided_answer": "these are methods of broadcast routing which do not waste the bandwidth or generate too many duplicates and are a variation of the spanning tree. in reverse path forwarding every sender has its own spanning tree but the is don't need to knwo them. it is considered that each router has information about which path it would use for packets. if a packet arrives at the is entry point it checks if this is the point over which they are usually sent. if this is the case, it is assumed that the packet used the best route until now and is therefore resend over all edges excluding the incoming one. if this is not the case and the packet arrived not over the best route, the packet is discarded. in reverse path broadcast the outgoing links are selected. first it will be checked if the packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this station are usually sent. if not, the packet is most likely a duplicate and will be discarded. if yes, it is checked if the packet has used the best route until now. if this is the case, the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to the source is selected for sending (in reverse direction). if this is not the case, the packet is not send over all edges (so not like in reverse path forwarding).",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "with reverse path forwarding, loops are avoided. each sender has its own spanning tree, but the is doesnt need to know all. while sending, ,stations pass the packets to the particular subnets. in  rpf, packets see a reachable list of stations when arriving at a station, and are eventually transmitted to all substations. with reverse path broadcast, packet paths are sent over the usually used path if they arrived via the most used path, else the are sent via a selected edge.",
        "answer_feedback": "the purpose is partially correct as it is only referring to rpf and does not explain how loops avoid duplicates forwarding during broadcasting. in rpf, there is no mention or description of the optimal path and how unicast information is used to derive that. the explanation of rpb is self-conflicting as it states that if it is not sent over the best path, it will be sent over the selected edge which is incorrect.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast prevent loops in networks. every router knows all routes to the other nodes but blocks all of them besides the shortest. if a packet now arrives at an intermediate system, it will be checked if the packet has used the shortest path so far by comparing the incoming direction with the usual direction packets with the same sender come from. in case it is the same direction it will be forwarded over every other edge besides the one where it has arrived. if it has arrived from another direction the packet will be discarded since it is most likely a duplicate. reverse path broadcast uses reverse path forwarding in an algorithm to send a packet to everyone with less duplicates than flooding.",
        "answer_feedback": "the purpose of both is to avoid forwarding of broadcast packets in loops/ duplicates like stated in the rpb explanation, not prevent loops in networks as stated in the first sentence. the description of the rpb algorithm is incorrect. rpb works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree. in rpf, if it followed the same route as the outgoing packet from the is is the correct explanation instead of stating the same direction.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

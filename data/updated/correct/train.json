        "reference_answer": "extension headers are used to extend the fixed ipv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. if present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nmain advantage: one of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. it allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. ipv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “hop-by-hop extension”) while they are processed by all routers in ipv4 unless ordered otherwise.",
        "provided_answer": "extension headers allow to put additional information between the fixed header and the payload by appending new options there.\n\nthe main advantage is that the fixed header is linked to the next header.this can be an upper layer header if no extension header is used or an extension header. the latter is in turn linked with the next header and so on what allows an arbitrary number of extension headers without having to change the fixed header for this. in contrast, the ipv4 fixed header only allows a limited number of custom options (tos field).",

        "provided_answer": "there are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * hidden terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. as an example, we can imagine that station a and c does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station b in the middle. so a and c both try to transmit data to c, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * exposed terminals: a problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. we can easily imagine a situation, where the stations b and c are in close proximity to each other, but where c cannot see b’s partner a and b cannot detect c’s partner d.  if b wants to send data to a, which is not visible to c, c has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner d is also blocked by b’s communication. in reality, c could send parallel to b, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. so we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * inherent heterogenity: as mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * dynamic source routing: due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. so one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based dynamic source routing in reactive routing protocols.",

        "provided_answer": "1.  to use temporarily valid tsapsto avoid duplicates we could use a unique tsap for every connection. this is an easy way to distinguish between duplicates. in theory this would solve our problem but in practical real-world scenarios this is not possible because we have designated well-known tsaps that do not change (e.g. http -> port 80)\n\n2. to identify connections individuallythis method wants to get rid of duplicates between connections. in this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports. one disadvantage of this is though that the endsystems have to remember the already assigned sequence numbers. so the endsystems have to store more information. also another issue to mention is that this works only for connection oriented systems, this won't work with connection-less systems. \n\n3. to identify pdus individually: individual sequential numbers for each pduto go even one step further we could identify the individual packets. so each packet get a unique sequence number. this is a very good way of avoiding duplicates. but for this to work we have to make sure that we chose a sensible sequence number range (depending on the packet rate and lifetime). and of course this method uses more bandwidth and memory",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

        "provided_answer": "one challenge that can occur in mobile networks are hidden terminals. meaning that two terminals a and c can communicate with another terminal b but because a is out of reach for c and c is out of reach for a they do not know when the other one is sending something. which can cause interference at terminal b. another challenge are so called exposed terminals. if many radio ranges of terminals overlap, a terminal will always wait if it recognises somebody else sending in its range. even if it would not cause interference in some cases because the waiting terminal would like to send to someone else who is not receiving anything. this means the waiting terminal is exposed which causes an underutilization of the channel and results in a lower throughput.",

        "provided_answer": "in my opinion, token ring or csma/cd are appropriate choices. depending on which requirements are more important, it's a tradeoff between cost, throughput and adding new users.  \nultimately, for the present case, i would choose the non-persistent csma/cd. non-persistent because it improves overall throughput (efficiency). \ncsma/cd has lower costs compared to token ring (cost efficient), which is important to the company as funding is tight. also, with csma/cd it is easier to add new users/stations (connect stations without shutting down the network). (i think, one could also choose p-persistent csma with small p, since the performances of p-persistent with small p and non-persistent are very similar at high load (slide 29) and p-persistent is a compromise between delay and throughput.)\nhowever, the disadvantage of csma/cd is that the number of collisions increases as the utilization increases, and there is poor throughput during high utilization periods. one disadvantage of non-persistent is that there are longer delays for single stations. for me, the cost and the simplicity of adding a new user were the main factors in favor of csma/cd, since token ring is much more expensive and it is more complex to add a new user.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

        "provided_answer": "a first challenge is called hidden terminals. this means, that there might are nodes existing who can not hear each other. as a consequence like the example in the lecture collisions can be caused because two nodes who can not hear each other, might are communicating with one in between them, because one sends to the one in the middle. the other one doesn't know. collision detection fails as well  a second challenge is \"near and far terminals\". here the distance between nodes influences the strength of the signal. as a consequence the one who is closer to the communication partner drowns out the weaker one. this can cause further problems because the communication between two nodes is not working.",

        "provided_answer": "broadcast routing with individual sending to every destination is bad because of waste of bandwidth and the sender has to know all destinations. also, flooding is not good because too many duplicates will exist. that's why reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is used. reverse path forwarding has the following algorithm implemented: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - yes: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) - no: discard the packet (most likely duplicate) reverse path broadcast has the following algorithm implemented: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - yes: packet used the best route until now?           - yes: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s (in reversed direction) ﻿﻿          - no: do not send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in reverse path forwarding (rpf) - no: discard the packet (most likely duplicate)",

        "reference_answer": "since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds",
        "provided_answer": "first of all we can derive all necessary values from the text: the buffer size is n=10, the arrival rate is ƛ = 9 and the service rate is μ = 10. as a next step, we can then calculate the change rate of the queue to ρ = ƛ/μ = 0.9. what we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. we use the formula p_n = ((1-ρ)ρ^n)/(1-ρ^(n+1)) for each single state. the state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: p(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. in the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: e(t | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s. so we expect the system to be for about 57s in a state with less than 10 waiting packets.",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. in reverse path forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. an accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. if packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. reverse path broadcasting makes use of the reverse path forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. if they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. by doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic, because usually data transfer on any layer happens in multiple, often many packets.\nif a machine initiates a data transfer, it is very likely that it wants to send more data than fitting in one packet, so it will send many\nof them in succession. in this case the time interval between the packet arrivals is not independent since they belong to one connection\nor data transfer. for example if a machine wants to receive a video stream of netflix, it will have a lot of packets continuously \n(although buffered) receiving from the netflix servers, so the arrivals of the packets of the video stream are not independent, therefore\nthe time intervals δt between them are also not independent.",

        "provided_answer": "both share the goal of flooding a network with some message while causing as few duplicates as possible. reverse path forwarding: a sender sends a message to another node via the shortest route. the receiver sends a message back to the sender via all of its adjacent nodes. if the original sender now receives the returnings packet from multiple routes and drops every packet that was received from a route other than the shortest one to the original receiver because those packages are considered duplicates. reverse path broadcast: all nodes inspect the sender and receiver of incoming packets and check if they have forwarded such messages in the past. based on the historical information they can now decide if they are part of the shortest route between sender and receiver of the inspected packet. the inspected packet is only forwarded further to nodes for which the inspecting node is part of the shortest path.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "we learned about reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. reverse path forwarding / reverse path flooding: the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. the spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. there can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to s? - if it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. reverse path broadcast the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. it basically works as reverse path forwarding with one difference: when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. a node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of rpf and rpb is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). in reverse path forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. they will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. every receiving node has to \"ask itself the question\": has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? if the answer is yes, it will assume that the received packets used the best route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. reverse path broadcast is a more complex version of rpf. in this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. every time a node receives packets it will have to \"ask itself\" two questions. first \"has this packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? if the answer is no, the packets will be discarded. otherwise it will \"ask itself\" the next question. \"have the packets used the best route until now?\" if the answer is yes the node will send the packets onto an edge. this edge lies on the best route from the destination node to the source node. otherwise the packets will be discarded.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, it does not hold. in real internet traffic, packet arrivals happen in bursts (or batches), the inter batch times are independent and exponentially distributed, and the batch sizes are random. the arriving packets are not independent and there is a high chance of receiving the following packets after receiving one. for instance, in torrent applications for file-sharing or web conferencing, the received packets should be related to the previous once.",

        "reference_answer": "since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast help to reduce unwanted duplication of broadcast packets. reverse path forwarding works by checking the incoming edge of a broadcast packet: if it is not the edge that this is would use for sending a packet to the broadcast source, the packet is discarded (because packets using any non-optimal path are considered duplicate). otherwise it is sent over all edges except the incoming one. reverse path broadcast works similar to rpf, but a packet is not forwarded to an adjacent node if the current is is not part of the optimal unicast path from the adjacent node to the broadcast source.",

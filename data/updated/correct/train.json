        "provided_answer": "i would recommend p-persistent csma mac procedure for this company. \nfirst reason: since we dont know how much users will use the system later, we need a versatile system. we can change the variable p, that dictates the chance of sending, according to how many people are using the network, and adjust the load on the the ether that way. when more users will join, p can be dialed down to allow for less collisions.\nsecond reason: as we saw on the lecture, the p-persistent can reach high throughput, and when there will be a lot of users using the system, this can be a useful property.\n\na potential weakness of the system is that the delay might be high. a message can be tried to be sent many times until it is sent in the end.",

        "reference_answer": "yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: cf and ei). this can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",
        "provided_answer": "it may cause problems in a network with load fluctuations because with a sending data over a path the load on this particular path increases and therefore a might choose another path creating a ping pong effect where finding the best path may not terminate because it switches the path constantly.\n\nanother problem may be that the links between the nodes have different maximum capacities, e. g. one link has 10 gbit/s and another link 1gbit/s. finding the path with the lowest current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes may choose the nearly full 1gbit/s link because of a relatively low utilization although the 10gbit/s link has more capacity.\n\nfurthermore this strategy may lead to a high latency since a connection with many hops but low loads may be preferred although the fastest path is not fully utilized.",

        "provided_answer": "1.  to use temporarily valid tsapsto avoid duplicates we could use a unique tsap for every connection. this is an easy way to distinguish between duplicates. in theory this would solve our problem but in practical real-world scenarios this is not possible because we have designated well-known tsaps that do not change (e.g. http -> port 80)\n\n2. to identify connections individuallythis method wants to get rid of duplicates between connections. in this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports. one disadvantage of this is though that the endsystems have to remember the already assigned sequence numbers. so the endsystems have to store more information. also another issue to mention is that this works only for connection oriented systems, this won't work with connection-less systems. \n\n3. to identify pdus individually: individual sequential numbers for each pduto go even one step further we could identify the individual packets. so each packet get a unique sequence number. this is a very good way of avoiding duplicates. but for this to work we have to make sure that we chose a sensible sequence number range (depending on the packet rate and lifetime). and of course this method uses more bandwidth and memory",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "the assumption doesn't hold for real internet traffic because people usually use their connection in some time frames (for example watching netflix) an then don't use ist fore some time (for example while sleeping) regularly.if there is a first packet more usually follow after that. so the time slot after a packet has a higher probability to also contain a packet.",

        "provided_answer": "no, this assumption is too strong for real internet traffic. the probability that you get another packet after you received one is much higher as e.g. video applications might fetch the next seconds of the video into the local buffer which causes a number of packets. after buffering a segment of the video, there is no traffic until the next video segment is fetched which again causes more traffic. furthermore, circumstances like the time of the day influence the traffic in different ways.",

        "provided_answer": "there are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * hidden terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. as an example, we can imagine that station a and c does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station b in the middle. so a and c both try to transmit data to c, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * exposed terminals: a problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. we can easily imagine a situation, where the stations b and c are in close proximity to each other, but where c cannot see b’s partner a and b cannot detect c’s partner d.  if b wants to send data to a, which is not visible to c, c has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner d is also blocked by b’s communication. in reality, c could send parallel to b, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. so we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * inherent heterogenity: as mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * dynamic source routing: due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. so one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based dynamic source routing in reactive routing protocols.",

        "provided_answer": "In this case I would recommend to use p-persistent CSMA with active Collision Detection feature. Compared to a token ring technology, CSMA is comperativeley cheap and easy scalable. A disadvantage may be the lower throughput caused by possible collisons compared to token ring, but for this CSMA provides better (lower) latency. With the collision detection the bandwith usage can be increased by quick collison recognition. P-persistent CSMA is defined by the p parameter, so it can also be adjusted to the specific needs and size of the company. Furthermore this technology provides a good compromise between throughput and delay (latency) which may both important parameters to look at for the company.",

On the one hand the MAC should be affordable and also able to deal with higher load, on the other hand it should be expandable for further use. In my opinion I would recommend to use CSMA/CD. Not only because it is most widely spread but also costs efficient which fits one of our prerequisites. Furthermore, CSMA/CD is also easier to expand in comparison with e.g. Token Ring. This fulfills our needs as well. One potential issue using CSMA/CD is that collision increases if utilization increases, this will lead to poor throughput during high utilization periods.",

        "provided_answer": "I would recommend Token Ring as the preferred MAC procedure for the given situation. Firstly, Token Ring has a good throughput even during high channel load, opposed to other MAC procedures. Secondly, as we have currently 20 systems sharing the same channel, it is unlikely that each of them sents a frame with the same length, especially if the network is supposed to expand later with more systems. In Token Ring Procedure, the length of the frames can be of variable size and is therefore good for a network with many systems, that send different sizes of frames.\n\nHowever, due to the aim of expanding the network with multiple systems, we will suffer from delays because each system has to wait for the token until it can send a frame.",

I would personally suggest in this case the Token Ring based approach, as it performes very good under high utilzation and is best used in an environment with just a few host in the system so that the latency is kept low.

Non-persistent because it improves overall throughput (efficiency). \nCSMA/CD has lower costs compared to Token Ring (cost efficient), which is important to the company as funding is tight. Also, with CSMA/CD it is easier to add new users/stations (connect stations without shutting down the network). (I think, one could also choose p-persistent CSMA with small p, since the performances of p-persistent with small p and non-persistent are very similar at high load (slide 29) and p-persistent is a compromise between delay and throughput.)\nHowever, the disadvantage of CSMA/CD is that the number of collisions increases as the utilization increases, and there is poor throughput during high utilization periods. One disadvantage of non-persistent is that there are longer delays for single stations. For me, the cost and the simplicity of adding a new user were the main factors in favor of CSMA/CD, since Token Ring is much more expensive and it is more complex to add a new user.",

        "provided_answer": "I would choose non-persistent CSMA with Collision Detection (CD).\nThe first reason is that CSMA procedure is costly efficient, so that would help the company, since the funding is tight.\nSecondly, CSMA procedure allows the LAN to have new stations and the addition does not require the shut down of the rest of the stations. This way, the expansion would be easier.\nOn the downside, CSMA results into many collisions, since two or more channels may want to send data the same time. For this reason, we choose non-persistent CSMA with Collision Detection, because firstly, non-persistent CSMA works better with LANs with high transmission load (by waiting for random times) and secondly, CD will save some time from sending an already destroyed frame. The problem of the collisions will still exist, but it will not be so huge (instead of other CSMA methods).",

We use the formula p_n = ((1-\u03c1)\u03c1^n)/(1-\u03c1^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492.

New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad.

        "provided_answer": "There are multiple ways how to detect duplicate packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented service.\nOne method is using only temporarily valid TSAPs, which are only valid for one connection.By using this method, neither the endsystem (ES) nor the sender has to\u00a0 store additional information over a \"long\" timeBit since this results in long length port numbers/ TSAPs, with this method results in a higher bandwidth. Additionally,\u00a0 \"well known\" TSAPs are present, making this method not suitable.\nAnother method is to identify each connection by assigning a sequence number (SeqNo) to each connection individually, while the ES remembers already assigned SeqNo.This allows the use of \"well known\" TSAPs while allowing detection of delayed duplicate packets. Compared to the text method, this way you have a lower bandwidth need in exchange for a higher memory need, since\u00a0the ES needs store this information, but this information needs to be available, whenever needed. Additionally, this method does not support connections-less systems.\nThe last method is that each Physical Data Unit (PDU) has an individual SeqNo.This way, ES do not need to store additional information for a longer time and \"well known\" TSAPs can be used.Furthermore, the SeqNo for PDUs would last for a long time, even assuming they aren't reset.

        "provided_answer": "Usage of temporarily valid TSAPs: This method addresses duplicate packages by switching TSAPs (e.g. ports) regularly and thus rejects duplicate packages that reach an outdated TSAP. This approach has the advantage that it handles duplicates very lightweight as the actual transport protocol does not need to care about duplicates when those are handled through binding the service to TSAPs. A disadvantage is that some services are per convention reached on a well-known TSAP (like e.g. a webserver at TCP port 80), where changing TSAPs would complicate finding the correct TSAP to connect to.Individual identification of connections: This method addresses duplicates by assigning each connection a SeqNo meaning a unique identifier that is remembered by the participating endsystems. This has the advantage that services can still be assigned to any well-known TSAP without conflict and this method solves receiving duplicate packages from a connection that has already been closed. A disadvantage is that the endsystems need to remember all previously assigned sequence numbers and those also need to be readily available, which would not be the case when e.g. the system is offline.Individual identification of PDUs: This method addresses duplicates be assigning each single PDU in all connections a unique SeqNo. This has the advantage that it definitely allows for uniquely identifying a package and immediately seeing whether we have seen this exact package before (and e.g. not just a equal package within the same connection). The disadvantage is that we have an increased overhead for duplicate detection as we have to maintain the numbering for each package.",

        "provided_answer": "1.\u00a0 to use temporarily valid TSAPsTo avoid duplicates we could use a unique TSAP for every connection. This is an easy way to distinguish between duplicates. In theory this would solve our problem but in practical real-world scenarios this is not possible because we have designated well-known TSAPs that do not change (e.g. HTTP -> port 80)\n\n2. to identify connections individuallyThis method wants to get rid of duplicates between connections. In this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. Again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports. One disadvantage of this is though that the endsystems have to remember the already assigned sequence numbers. So the endsystems have to store more information. Also another issue to mention is that this works only for connection oriented systems, this won't work with connection-less systems.\u00a0\n\n3. to identify PDUs individually: individual sequential numbers for each PDUTo go even one step further we could identify the individual packets. So each packet get a unique sequence number. This is a very good way of avoiding duplicates. But for this to work we have to make sure that we chose a sensible sequence number range (depending on the packet rate and lifetime). And of course this method uses more bandwidth and memory",

        "provided_answer": "For six flips there is only one combination out of all possible results of H and T, so that the sequence\nHHHTTT occurs.

But since the combinations for seeing exactly three H's are more limited than for seeing at\nleast three H's, C is a lot less probable than A.\nSince P[H] = 0.6, we get the probability of tails showing up with \n\nP[T] = 1 - P[H] = 0.4\n\nSo for event B, we get\n\nP[HHHTTT] = 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 = 0.013824\n\nFor event C, the number of times of heads showing up follows a binomial distribution, so therefore we get with Y being the number of times\nH is showing up with N = 6 total flips and k = 3 the number of times H showing up being examined:\n\nP[Y=3] = 6!/(3!*(6-3)!) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^(6-3) = 0.27648\n\nFor event A, we have the same binomial distribution, but since we also accept H showing up more than 3 times, we add up the probabilities:\n\nP[Y>=3] = P[Y=3] + P[Y=4] + P[Y=5] + P[Y=6] = 6!/(3!*3!)*0.6^3*(0.4)^3 + 6!/(4!*2!)*0.6^4*(0.4)^2 + 6!/(5!*1!)*0.6^5*(0.4)^1 + 0.6^6 = 0.8208\n\nTherefore, we get the likelihoods of the events in increasing order: B, C, A",

The Unconfirmed Connectionless service does not include confirmation and assumes that the sent packets have arrived correctly. By confirming in the Confirmed Connectionless  service, this service can ensure that all packets have arrived at the receiver. Lost packets cannot be confirmed and so the recipient sends the packet again after a specified timeout. Both mentioned services have no flow control and no explicit requests to establish or disconnect a connection. The Confirmed Connectionless service has an implicit confirmation if a connection can be established, exactly when its packets are confirmed by the receiver. The confirmation of the second service class can cause duplicates to appear at the receiver, when the confirmation of a packet does not arrive at the sender. The third service class executes a three-phase communication and tries to establish a connection first. If the connection is confirmed, packets are sent until a request for disconnection is sent and confirmed. If the communication takes place over an error-free channel, no losses, no duplicates and no sequence errors are to be expected. Flow control is guaranteed by the \"handshake\". The first service type is usually used for the transition of isolated single units in channels with very low error rate (e.g. LANs, voice communication).

For example, there are the following four differences between the headers of the two protocols: \n- First of all, TCP includes a sequence number for sending to ensure that all packages can be organized by the receiver in the same order as they were sent. UDP does not give any information about the right sequence of packages, so there is no guarantee for the order that the receiver gets or can create.\n- Furthermore, TCP gives reliability to the users by also including a field for acknowledgements in the header. To be more precise, the included sequence number works as an acknowledgement for a package receiver earlier. On the other hand, UDP does not give any guarantee concerning reliability of service, so there is no space in the header for any kind of acknowledgement. \n- What is more, TCP includes possibilities for flow and congestion control by dynamically adjusting the window size for sending and receiving packets at the same time. This process makes use of the \u201cAdvertised window\u201d field in the header which can be used by a receiver to transmit its optimal window size for reception of packets. UDP on the other hand does not include such features, so there is no space for windowing in the header. \n- Finally, TCP also gives the user possibilities to prioritize packages for urgent processing at the receiver process. Therefore, the header includes the so called 16-bit \u201cUrgent Pointer\u201d which is an offset to the sequence number and marks the last octet of a sequence of highly prioritized packets.

The additional bytes of the TCP header length are for the Sequence Number, Acknowledge Number, HL/RESV/Flags, Advertised Win, Urgent Pointer and the options.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "This assumption does not hold for the real internet traffic.\nData packets are often sent in bursts or packet trains, especially in applications such as streaming. Therefore, over a higher time scale the probability of multiple arrivals of data packets one after another is high and no longer independent from one another. On the flip side, the chance that no arrival happens in an interval deltaT is higher, if there has not been an arrival in the previous interval. \nIn streaming for instance, multiple data packets are sent in bursts and buffered at the receiver to reliably guarantee a steady video stream.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side.

        "provided_answer": "One challenge in mobile routing is the so-called hidden terminal problem. As nodes have an inherently limited transmission range, different nodes in the network may be located to far from each other to directly be able to communicate. However, there can be other nodes in the intersection range of these nodes that can send and receive to/ from both sides, increasing the risk of transmission collisions from the hidden nodes. Also, the limited transmission range itself poses a challenge fro mobile routing as the signal strength of a sending node decreases proportionally to the square of the distance. Therefor, stronger signals from nearer nodes can completely overwrite weaker signals from more distant nodes.",

        "provided_answer": "1. Hidden Terminals: In mobile routing we communicate wireless. Consider the setup from slide 11: A to B, C to B. In here, node A can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node C. Node C can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node A. The hidden terminal problem occurs when node A and node B want to send data to node B at the same time. This results in collsions and waste of resources. The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C. As a consequence, node C knows that nothing can be sent to B for a certain amount of time. If node C wants to send something to B, C needs to reserve the channel too by a RTS. 2. Near and Far Terminals: - Consider the setup from slide 18: We have three nodes A, B and C. B and C are relatively close to each other while A has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. The problem of near and far terminals occurs when A and B want to send something to C at the same time. Due to the fact that the signal strength decreases the larger the distance is, the signal of B drowns out the weaker signal of A. As a consequence, C cannot receive anything from A.",

        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals: In mobile communication, one challenge is, that several nodes cant hear each other. Therefore if two Nodes that can't hear each other communicate with a third node both can reach a collision at this third node can occur. Further, the first two nodes cannot sense the collision and thus the communication is very unreliable, in addition to the waste of resources that always comes with collisions. This problem can be avoided if the third Node sends a \"busy tone\" to the first two nodes if it receives data by one of those nodes and therefore the other one keeps silent. However, a separate channel for the busy tones is needed. Exposed Terminals: Example with the four Terminals: A B C D. Each terminal reaches only its neighbours. If B sends data to A and C wants to send data to D, C can sense the transmission of B and A and therefore has to wait, even though A is outside the range of C and therefore a collision would not occur.

        "provided_answer": "Two challenges in Mobile Routing are Hidden Terminals and Exposed Terminals. With Hidden Terminals, the challenge occurs when two nodes that are not in range of each other both try to communicate with another node that they are both in reach with. For example node A and C are not in range of each other but can both communicate with node B. Now when node A sends something to B, then C cannot receive this transmission. Because of that C will think that B is free for transmission and might also send data to B. This simultaneous transmission will result in a collision and a loss of data from both A and C. With Exposed Terminals we imagine the example from above with another node D that is only in range of C. Now if B is sending data to A and C wants to send data to D. C will then see that the carrier is busy and has to wait until it detects it to be idle.

        "provided_answer": "There are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. Two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * Hidden Terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. As an example, we can imagine that station A and C does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station B in the middle. So A and C both try to transmit data to C, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * Exposed Terminals: A problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. We can easily imagine a situation, where the stations B and C are in close proximity to each other, but where C cannot see B\u2019s partner A and B cannot detect C\u2019s partner D.  If B wants to send data to A, which is not visible to C, C has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner D is also blocked by B\u2019s communication. In reality, C could send parallel to B, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. So we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * Inherent Heterogenity: As mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. Therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * Dynamic Source Routing: Due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in \u201cnormal\u201d networks. So one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based Dynamic Source Routing in reactive routing protocols.",

        "provided_answer": "The first challenge: geographical problem: because of mobile devices, meaning devices can freely move from one geographical point to another simultaneously. Transmission range may dramatically vary because of devices\u2019 free movement and the connection between any arbitrary nodes could no longer be available at different point in time in the future, although in the past, they are able to talk to each other. For this reason, mobile routing should take into account the geographical information to perform routing successfully in such scenario because the network is not fixed. \n\t \n\t The second challenge: unreliable wireless medium problem: because wireless network communication tends to be involved in mobile routing between mobile devices. The medium reliability could possibly greatly vary from urban environment to rural area. That introduces many problems such as medium access control, signal attenuation, collision avoidance, since listen-while-talk medium access control is not possible in wireless network. For this reason, some mobile routing protocol employs reactive routing strategy in its design, meaning routing path, routing information is not beforehand calculated when there is no need to do such routing, because the network cannot reliably assume that there will always be incoming messages to be forwarded according to the routing table which has been carefully calculated before because the network is not wired.",

Nodes can join the network if they are in range and attacks like DOS are easy to perform. There is no boundary between the inside network and the outside world.

        "provided_answer": "We learned about Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. Reverse Path Forwarding / Reverse Path Flooding: The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. Therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. The spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. There can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: Is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to S? - If it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - Otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. Reverse Path Broadcast The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. It basically works as Reverse Path Forwarding with one difference: When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. A node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",

Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not.

        "provided_answer": "REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing. Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The principle of RPF is each sender has its own Spanning Tree but IS does not need to know the Spanning Trees. Each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Algorithm of RPF is as below: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. TRPB routing is an extension of RPB routing. It ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. The principle of RPB is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. A router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. The Algorithm of RPB is as below: Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent?  YES: Packet used the BEST route until now?   YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction)  NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)  NO: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",

The best route in this case, is the one you would normally use in a unicast transmission.  If the incoming package has NOT taken the best route, it is discarded as it is most likely a copy.   If it HAS taken the best route the router forwards the package.

        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and  Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) are techniques used for Multi- and Broadcast communication. Their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each IS can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   In Reverse Path Forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. If a unicast packet from A to C passes a router B frequently, B knows that it is on the shortest path from A to C and reverse. If, on the other hand, a router D never sees any unicast packets from A to C, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. This information is then used when a flooding packet from A or C (sender) arrives at either C or D (IS). Only if the IS is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   Reverse Path Broadcasting is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. Not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the IS entry port, where it received the multicast packets like RPF does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. In contrast to RPF, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, RPB attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. Namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

Both algorithms use spanning tree for router initiating broadcast, which is based on a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

Intermediate systems (IS) must not know the spanning trees. Once a packet arrived at a IS there are two possible ways to forward: (assuming shortest path transmission/\u201dbest route\u201d) * Once a packet arrived from node A on the same link as node B expect packets by its routing table, then this packet will be forwarded to all other links except the incoming link. * Once a packet arrived from node A on another link as node B expect packets from A, then this packet will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): Works like RPF but chooses specific links for the outgoing traffic. By forwarding unicast packets an IS e.g. M learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node S and D). If this is not the case and S is sending a broadcasting packet, M would not forward this packet towards D as it knows that it is not on the shortest path from S to D. If M has learned that it is on the shortest path, it will obviously forward a broadcast packet to the destination.

As a consequence,\nIPv6 allows to support billion of end-systems due to larger address space (according to wikipedia 2^128 different ip addresses possible)\n\n2. increase of security\n- the protocol IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) allows to achieve the security goals confidentiality, authenticity and integrity on the network level. For instance, this can prevent the manipulation of the IP source address or the content of the IP datagram (integrity protection).\n- IPSec is supported by IPv6 by default\n\n3. simplify protocol processing\n- due to a simplified IP header in IPv6 the protocol processing becomes less complex for routers. In general one can say that the header of an IPv6 packet has less fields to process, e.g. the header checksum is removed (can be handled on layer 2 or layer 4).

Then send them all ( all packet in the queue) in a single transmission. So, we have not only one but multiple frames in this single transmission.\n\n-Advantage: It will increase the efficiency, good for Data Transfer. \nExplain:\n+ If we send each frame individually, each frame must be attached with some additional field(like checksum...), these fields are not data. The receiver will throw them away anyway.\n + If we can reduce these fields as much as we can, we can increase the efficiency. And the \"frame bursting \" is the idea. Instead of inserting additional fields for every packet, we gather multiple packets together, and insert the additional fields into this single burst.\n\n-Disadvantage: Very high delay.

        "provided_answer": "The solution for maintaining a high collision domain diameter with increased transmission speed is to also increase the length of the sent frames. Frame bursting in this context means combining multiple small frames to one concatenated sequence of then increased length. This allows collision detection on the same length of line as before with increased speed because incread sequence length and higher transmission speed together mean a unchanged duration of transmission for every node in the network. \nWe have to have a look on the advantages and disadvantages of frame bursting, especially in comparison to carrier extension. Carrier extension is another attempt to longer frames by adding more zero-padding bits to every frame with the same data section length as before:\n\n-Advantage: In comparison to carrier extension, the long sequences in frame bursting contain more information, because no (or at least less) zero padding is needed. So the percentage of data per sequence is higher than it is with carrier extension, where most of the package consists of padding fields. So we have a higher efficiency, especially in respect of line usage.\n\n-Disadvantage: Frame bursting needs time of waiting for every node before sending, because a certain amount of frames has to be collected to concatenate them to a sequence of minimum length.

        "provided_answer": "Frame bursting is a concept which is supported by Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3z) in shared broadcast mode. This concept allows the sender to transfer multiple frames as a concatenated sequence to the recipient with only one transmission. \n\nAdvantage: \nTo understand the advantage of frame bursting we need to compare it with another concept which is also supported by Gigabit Ethernet: Carrier extension. Carrier extension ensures to reach the minimal frame size by using padding which may (!) result in a waste of brandwith. This is the case if you need to add a large padding to reach the minimum frame size. As a solution, frame bursting optimizes the relation between actual payload and padding.

Frame bursting is more efficient than carrier extension, but it requires some wait time before sending in order to collect enough frames to concatenate.

This can be a manual or an automatic assignment. In manual mode, a specific IP address will be permanently assigned to a certain MAC address. In automatic mode, an IP address will be temporarily assigned (lease) and freed if no renewal occurs. This provides efficient use of addresses without blocking addresses if no device uses it. The DHCP server is configured to manage a pool of possible IP addresses in the network and also knows other configuration data (e.g. DNS, netmask).\nThe DHCP protocol also allows to configure the network elements with other important network details like DNS servers, netmask, default router, and other items. If a network element needs to join a network, it sends a broadcast message (DISCOVER) to the network. A DHCP server picks this message up and provides the necessary information to the network element as described above. There should not be more than 1 DHCP server in a network.

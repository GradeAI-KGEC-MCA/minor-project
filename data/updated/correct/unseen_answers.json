        "provided_answer": "csma/cd does not work for wireless transmission. main issue is the broadcast nature of mobile transmission. * hidden terminal problem: firstly, carrier sense fails because a station that want to send cannot “see” another station already  sending to its destination as it is not in the transmission range of the other sending station. secondly, there is no collision detection after the collision arised. this leads to a higher amount of collisions, a wastage of resources and unreliability. for example: * station a sends to station b; station c is not in the range of a, thus, does not receive a’s signal * c performs carrier sensing as it wants to send to b, senses a free medium * c sends to b which causes collision at b; a cannot detect the collision (as it is a wireless scenario) * station a and c are hidden from each other\n\t * exposed terminal problem: the “exposed” station is waiting to transmit a signal, as it hears a signal from another transmitting station. thus, it tries to prevent a collision which actually will not occur as the receiver of the other sending station is outside of its range. this leads to underutilization of the channel and a decreased effective throughput. for example: * station b sends to station a; station c wants to send to another station outside of b’s transmission range * c performs carrier sensing and senses a busy medium, thus it has to wait * a is outside of c’s transmission range, thus, c actually does not need to wait as it would not cause a collision at a; c is exposed to b",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network. the idea of both algorithms is the use of so called “spanning trees” for each individual node in the network, which contain routes to every subnode in every subnetwork. since one intermediary system does only know his own spanning tree, but not the ones of the surrounding nodes, each router has to use its knowledge of optimal routing for certain destinations as a criterion for further transmission. for reverse path forwarding this means, that each node has to check the link on which an incoming packet is received. if this link is the optimal one, over which packets for this station are also usually sent, then node can assume that the packet has taken an optimal way up to it. as a consequence, it then re-sends the packet over all of its edges, but not the one on which the packet was received. if the packet on the other hand does not come over such an “optimal” link it gets discarded.  since re-sending over all edges seems not to be the most efficient way of multicast-routing, reverse path broadcast introduces a further check for packets that arrive over the optimal link as well as a limited re-transmission of packets: if a packet has taken the optimal path until this station, the station reroutes the packet over the optimal incoming link to the source in reversed direction. this means, that the receiving node looks up in its routing table over which link such a packet would normally be received. exactly this link is then used for rerouting the packet to the source instead of using all links as it is done before in reverse path forwarding. otherwise (so to say if the packet is not received on an optimal link or received on an optimal link, but has not taken an optimal path so far), the packet is not resent. this mechanism is implemented to limit the number of duplicates in the network - while reverse path forwarding retransmits over all edges (excluding the one on which the packet was received), reverse path broadcasting chooses the most suitable link for retransmission.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, this assumption will most likely not hold true for real internet traffic. this has multiple reasons:\n\npackets on the internet are grouped into frames for sending, making lone packets being sent separately rather unlikely.  \nthe nature of data transfer on the internet also makes lone packets very unlikely. when making a request for data through the internet (for example loading a web page), the response includes a lot of data (markup, text, images) which are all sent in a short amount of time, and after the page has been loaded the user will most likely spend some time browsing the page before making another request.  \ntherefore we cannot treat arriving packets as independent from one another, because there is a very high chance that an arriving packet is related to the previous packet.",

        "provided_answer": "the purpose of these two algorithms is the efficient (e.g. compared to flooding) execution of broadcast routing, i.e. the sending of packets to all other hosts in the subnet. mode of operation: both are based on the idea of the spanning tree to use the shortest possible paths from the sender to the receivers. _rpf_ forwards a broadcast packet arriving on one link over all other links only if it arrives over a link over which, according to its own routing table, packets are also routed to the sender of the broadcast (i.e. it is assumed that the packet arrived on the best path), otherwise the packet is discarded. _rpb_ differs from _rpf_ in the way it forwards packets: a packet is only forwarded to a direct neighbouring node if the forwarding node would also be located on a unicast path between the sender and that neighbouring node. for example, if a node b receives a broadcast packet from a and b has links with c and d, but has previously learned that no packets are routed from a to c via b, but to d via b, then it will not forward the packet to c (unlike _rpf_), but only to d. this further reduces the number of messages compared to _rpf_.",

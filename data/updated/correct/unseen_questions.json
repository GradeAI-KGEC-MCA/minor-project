        "provided_answer": "benefit 1: software defined networking allows more flexibility, because a device's logic is not hardcoded in the hardware. instead of designing and building a new piece of hardware, with sdn one can simply change the logic by using a high level programming language.\nbenefit 2: sdn allows us to source out the control logic of a switch, where performance is expensive, to a server where much more performance is available. this also reduces the complexity of the switch itself, because the logic is handled by the server.\ndrawback 1: the cap problem occurs, meaning that with sdn we can only achieve two of the following attributes at a time: consistency, availability, partition tolerance. a prioritization has to be made for each network.\ndrawback 2: because the controllers are now responsible for the control logic of the entire network, the controllers get very complex and, in case of a distributed network, even have to handle communication with each other.",

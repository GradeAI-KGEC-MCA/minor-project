Is it better to use a connection-oriented or connectionless service for your communication in this scenario? Explain your answer in 1-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Connectionless, because you will communicate with various partners (websites) for short periods of time. If you would initiate a connection with every website you skim, that would incur a lot of overhead in the connecting and disconnecting phase, just to have very short data transfers.",
        "provided_answer": "We want to consider, how our process will be changed, if a result to a query will not be shown to us, because of a connection error. Depending on our strategy, if the piece of information we search for not being shown to us will lead to us refining our query in a way, that we will not be shown the piece of information again, then we should use a connected-oriented service. Otherwise, if us refining the query will not lead to us always missing out on the piece of information we search for, a connectionless service will do as some results not being shown will hinder the iterative process too much.",

        "provided_answer": "It is better to use a connectionless service. Connectionless service is used in the network system to transfer data from one end to another end without creating any connection. \n\nSo it does not require establishing a connection before sending the data from the sender to the receiver. It is not a reliable network service because it does not guarantee the transfer of data packets to the receiver, and data packets can be received in any order to the receiver. Therefore we can say that the data packet does not follow a defined path. \n\nA connectionless communication has an advantage over a connection-oriented communication, in that it has low overhead. It also allows for Browsing, multicast and broadcast operations in which the same data are transmitted to several recipients in a single transmission.",

So the data plane consists of all end systems as well as switches who are simplified in comparison to normal networks and just handle the forwarding process very efficiently. The controlling of the switches - so to say the definition of routes by forwarding rules - happens in the control plane, which consists of different physically separated servers that run so called control logic units. Their task is to evaluate the current traffic on the data plane as well as the network graph and deciding about new routes and forwarding table entries, which are then communicated to the switches. The SDN controllers are hosts that implement the control plane and the southbound interface to the switches. They have several tasks, for example especially the configuration of the forwarding tables in the switches, but also the collection of statistical data about the network traffic from the forwarding switches.",

        "provided_answer": "Two of the main benefits of SDN are the following ones: \n- First of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. This plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. \n- As it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don\u2019t have to include a complex control logic anymore. They get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don\u2019t have to figure them out by themselves. \n\nOf course, there are also disadvantages of Software Defined Networking: \n- Security protection is a major concern in SDN since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. So the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. \n- In order to establish SDN, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane.

Only two out of the three CAP properties - consistency, availability and partitioning tolerance - are possible.\nDepending on how often the switches are reconfigured, the traffic between the control nodes and switches may become relevant and even slow down the overall network traffic.

        "provided_answer": "Benefits:\nA primary advantage of SDN networking is greater visibility throughout the network. In traditional networking, any security that impacts traffic is overarching. With SDN, it's granular. This means that engineers can selectively block malicious traffic throughout your network on a granular basis.\n\nTraditional networking requires significant people power and technical expertise spread throughout your network. Each hardware component must be maintained, and connections must be monitored broadly. A SDN network allows all of these hardware components to be managed via a single touchpoint.\n\nDrawbacks:\nOne of the problems with virtualizing any infrastructure is the latency that arises as a result. The speed of the interaction with an appliance is dependent on how many virtualized resources are available. \n\nOne of the most significant security risk factors is the possibility of a compromised SDN controller attack at the control plane layer. Due to the centralization design of the SDN, the SDN controller becomes the brain of the SDN architecture.

        "question": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of SDN compared to traditional networking,where each switch/router has to manage forwarding and routing on its own? Describe two benefits and two drawbacks in 1-2 sentences each. ",
        "reference_answer": "Benefits:\n\u25cf Reduced complexity of the switches: They only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n\u25cf Due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n\u25cf Better Integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n\u25cf Increased flexibility :\n1. We can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (Note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. API to \u201cprogram\u201d the network: Software (application) \u201cdefines\u201d the\nnetwork\n3. High-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nNote: In case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\u25cf High complexity of the control servers: They have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n\u25cf Centralized routing in distributed systems in general: The routing completely depends\non the control server(s). To achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. However, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. \u2192 CAP problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n\u25cf New technology adoption challenges:\n\u25cf Switching to SDN from traditional networking.\n\u25cf Training personnel on SDN.\nAll these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the ROI.\n\u25cf Security-related concerns :\n\u25cb Lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.",
        "provided_answer": "A benefit of SDN is that the complexity of switches is reduced as the control logic is hosted in the control plane while switches still support forwarding in hardware which ensures the same performance as in traditional networks. \nAnother benefit is that the usage of high-level programming languages is possible in SDN, where traditional networking controllers/devices mostly have different and often low level programming languages through the presence of many different manufacturers.\n\nA drawback of SDN is that the logical centralization of the controller complicates its implementation as the controller ideally should support all CAP properties, i.e. consistency, availability, and partitioning tolerance.\n\nAnother drawback is the security. If the centralized control plane is compromised the whole network can be controlled by a miscreant.",

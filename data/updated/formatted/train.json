        "provided_answer": "there are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * hidden terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. as an example, we can imagine that station a and c does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station b in the middle. so a and c both try to transmit data to c, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * exposed terminals: a problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. we can easily imagine a situation, where the stations b and c are in close proximity to each other, but where c cannot see b’s partner a and b cannot detect c’s partner d.  if b wants to send data to a, which is not visible to c, c has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner d is also blocked by b’s communication. in reality, c could send parallel to b, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. so we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * inherent heterogenity: as mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * dynamic source routing: due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. so one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based dynamic source routing in reactive routing protocols.",

        "provided_answer": "mobile routing has different challenges, since communication does not happen on a wired medium and is therefore broadcast by nature.  1. hidden terminals: if two nodes, a and c, can't hear each other due to their distance, and there is a node b located in the intersection of their transmission, their transmissions can collide at node b without a and c noticing it. csma/cd does not work here, since a and c will not hear each other and can therefore not detect a collision.   2. exposed terminal problem: station b transmits to station a at the same time c wants to transmit to d. if c senses the medium. it will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to d, but it’s unnecessary because these two transmissions don’t interfere each other. this leads to an underutilization of the channel.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "two challenges in mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. with hidden terminals, the challenge occurs when two nodes that are not in range of each other both try to communicate with another node that they are both in reach with. for example node a and c are not in range of each other but can both communicate with node b. now when node a sends something to b, then c cannot receive this transmission. because of that c will think that b is free for transmission and might also send data to b. this simultaneous transmission will result in a collision and a loss of data from both a and c. with exposed terminals we imagine the example from above with another node d that is only in range of c. now if b is sending data to a and c wants to send data to d. c will then see that the carrier is busy and has to wait until it detects it to be idle. but since a is not within the interference range of c waiting is not needed and results in under-utilization of resources.",

        "provided_answer": "hidden terminals:  two nodes a and c try to communicate with a third node b, however a and c are not aware of the other station respectively because they are not within range of each other. node b is within range of both though, therefore collisions happen and the data which is sent to b get corrupted. exposed terminals:  there are four nodes a,b,c,d. if node c is within range of node b and b is sending data to a, c will notice that b is currently sending and will wait until b is finished before starting to send it's own data.  however, if the destination of b's transmission (in this case a) is not within range of c, and c wants to send data to d, there actually is no risk of collisions and c would be free send. that fact that c will wait for b to finish results in unused bandwidth.

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose of these broadcast routing algorithm is to reduce the amount of duplicates going to the network while sending a broadcast packet. reverse path forwarding: a broadcast packet will be forwarded on all edges (except the incoming edge), only if the packet was received on the edge which would be used for a unicast packet (fastest/best route). this is to eliminate packets which are coming over a longer path. reverse path broadcast: a broadcast packet will be forwarded only on those edges which are part of the best routes for a reversed unicast to the sender. also it holds true that a packet is only forwarded if the packet was received on the edge which would be used for a unicast packet (fastest/best route).",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast aim to reduce the number of packet copies in the network. in reverse path forwarding, a node forwards a packet if the packet used the entry over which the packets for the source would be sent. this means, if the packet used the best-known route, the node then forwards to all edges, except the incoming one.   in reverse path broadcast, a node forwards a packet if the packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets would be sent to the source station (used the best-known route). if the packet arrived on the best-known route, the node forwards the packet to selected edges: the edges used to reroute on the reverse direction to the source. example of rpb: if a node a is not in the best-known route from b to c, then a will not forward a packet to b when the packet source is c.",

        "provided_answer": "rpf and rpb are algorithms used to reduce the number of duplicate and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths. in rpf, if an is receives a packet from a source over which it would normally receive unicast packets, it can assume the packet has taken the optimal path so far, and it forwards it over all outbound edges.  if it did not come over the port unicast packets normally would, then the is discards the packet. in rpb, only specific outgoing ports are selected rather than all ports.  if an is receives a packet from a source that it would normally receive packets from, it will only forward the packets on the outgoing ports for which it is on the optimal path from source to destination, rather than forwarding on all outgoing ports as in rpf.  the is knows whether it is on the optimal path by inspecting unicast packets.  if the packet did not come on a port from which the is would normally receive packets, then the is can discard the message (as in rpf).",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. they enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. if this is the case, no forwarding takes place to avoid loops. reverse path forwarding (also called reverse path flooding) (rpf) is a variation of the method spanning tree. each sender has its spanning tree. the other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. the assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  the rpf algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. if yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. if not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. this duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. the significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. if a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. as soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. the disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. the reverse path broadcast (rpb) is like rpf but with a specific selection of outgoing links. after the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. if yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s. if not, it won't send over all edges. reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",

        "provided_answer": "all senders/receivers have a defined range. if the range does not reach a station, they cannot communicate with each other. and if some stations both have one station in their range like a cellular tower that can receive data from only one device, their data transmission can interfere without the knowledge of each other. the intermediate station has to decide which data to forward. this challenge is called \"hidden terminal\", because a (or c) is hidden from c (or a). another challenge is called the exposed terminal. when one station has many other station in its range, but just wants to send data to one specific, the other stations in its range have to wait. during this time, the other stations will not send or receive any data, because they sense the medium (e.g. air) is already in use. for example: a and c are in range of b. b wants to send data to a and uses a wireless connection over air. c then receives the data as well, because it is not adressed to c, it will discard the messages. during this process, c cannot communicate with b or any other station that is in its range (also if b cannot see it).",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "this assumption is not 100% applicable due to the fact, that there are packets which are dependent on each other like tcp packets. in this case, in order to estabilish a tcp connection, pecific packets have to be sent, which are strict dependent on each other. if we have a tcp connection, which starts at time t and ends at time t+n, there are some packets in this time period, which are dependent on each other.",

        "provided_answer": "to still be able to detect collisions at a high speed (as in the gigabit ethernet protocol), longer packets are needed. there are several options to form a larger frame size and one of them is frame bursting. in this method a set of shorter packets is concatenated and then all the packets are sent together as one large frame. \n\nthe advantage of this method is that there is a high efficiency/high throughput, as every part of a frame consists of usable data in comparison to carrier extension where padding is added to every frame and only a short percentage of a frame contains data.\n\nthe disadvantage of this method is a higher end-to-end delay as we need to wait in order for the buffer to fill up, which poses a disadvantage especially in interactive services. in comparison, the carrier extension method is much faster because every packet is sent directly. furthermore, another problem occurs when the buffer is partly vacant and no more data comes in to fill it up. in that case the data already present in the buffer has to wait and cannot be sent.",

        "provided_answer": "the appealing property of a spanning tree formed from a network/graph is the fact that all nodes are minimally connected (i.e. no loops are included). if the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes. this means that the is are not unnecessarily charged with messages during a broad-/multicast.  in order that all is know the multicast trees, the link state packages can be extended with information about the multicast groups. the row with destination and distance is expanded by the column indicating the multicast group membership of the destination. since these packages are distributed to all nodes by broadcast, the is can calculate the multicast tree for a certain multicast group independently once it has the information completely available locally to determine the outgoing lines for sending/forwarding the packages.",

        "reference_answer": "possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "challenges of mobile routing as compared to routing in fixed and wired networks: * dynamic topology: changes in topology are more common and frequent for mobile networks. and routing protocols in fixed and wired networks create routing tables independent of demand which can be very costly in mobile routing. * power and bandwidth: mobile devices have limited battery and bandwidth available to them and hence routing algorithms need to be extremely efficient and use as little of both as possible. * security: mobile networks have a wider range of security threats than wired networks. nodes can join the network if they are in range and attacks like dos are easy to perform. there is no boundary between the inside network and the outside world. the unpredictable and dynamic topology means that no safe routes can be established and reused. for eg: black hole attacks. qos: quality of service guarantees are much more difficult to ensure for mobile networks.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding is that the intermediate systems (is) do not need to know the spanning trees. instead, each sender has its own spanning tree. when a packet arrives at an is it checks whether this packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this sender are usually also sent, meaning that no other packet from the same sender arriving at the is has used a better route so far. if this is the case, the incoming packet is forwarded over all edges except from the incoming one. if not, the packet gets discarded since it is not using the best route and most likely is a duplicate. the purpose of reverse path broadcast is to prevent the resending over all edges as it is the case with reverse path forwarding and instead only forward the packets over suitable edges. when a packet arrives at an is, it also checks whether the packet used the best route until now like above. the difference is that in this case only the edge, at which the packets which are rerouted to the sender, arrive, is selected for forwarding the incoming packet. key point is that path information gained by inspecting unicast packets is leveraged at each is to prevent unnecessary transmissions.",

        "provided_answer": "the three services are called unconfirmed connectionless service, confirmed connectionless service and connection-oriented service. these differ in their characteristics and areas of application. the first two services differ in whether or not the receiver acknowledges a packet when it receives it. the unconfirmed connectionless service does not include confirmation and assumes that the sent packets have arrived correctly. by confirming in the confirmed connectionless  service, this service can ensure that all packets have arrived at the receiver. lost packets cannot be confirmed and so the recipient sends the packet again after a specified timeout. both mentioned services have no flow control and no explicit requests to establish or disconnect a connection. the confirmed connectionless service has an implicit confirmation if a connection can be established, exactly when its packets are confirmed by the receiver. the confirmation of the second service class can cause duplicates to appear at the receiver, when the confirmation of a packet does not arrive at the sender. the third service class executes a three-phase communication and tries to establish a connection first. if the connection is confirmed, packets are sent until a request for disconnection is sent and confirmed. if the communication takes place over an error-free channel, no losses, no duplicates and no sequence errors are to be expected. flow control is guaranteed by the \"handshake\". the first service type is usually used for the transition of isolated single units in channels with very low error rate (e.g. lans, voice communication). the second service type can be used for channels with a high error rate such as mobile communication. the last service type is preferred for long and persistent communication.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding (rpf) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent ip address spoofing in unicast routing. network administrators can use unicast reverse path forwarding (unicast rpf) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. this security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. the principle of rpf is each sender has its own spanning tree but is does not need to know the spanning trees. each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. algorithm of rpf is as below: has this packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? yes: assumption: packet used the best route until now action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) no: assumption: packet did not use this route (it is not the best route) action: discard packet (most likely duplicate reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. trpb routing is an extension of rpb routing. it ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. the principle of rpb is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. a router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. the algorithm of rpb is as below: has this packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this station/source s are usually also sent?  yes: packet used the best route until now?   yes: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s (in reversed direction)  no: do not send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in reverse path forwarding (rpf)  no: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",

        "provided_answer": "spanning trees are interesting for broad- and multicasting because they represent a subset of a graph that contains all nodes but no loops. if every router in the network knows about the structure of the spanning tree, it can simply forward a received broadcast to the remaining spanning tree lines without creating duplicates or not using the bandwidth optimally. in the link state algorithm all stations have information about the existing other stations and can create a model of the topology by themselves. this model can then be used to create a spanning tree that fulfills the advantages mentioned above.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast are routing algorithms that are used for multicast routing scenarios. to adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. the principle of the reverse path forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations. the packets are flooded from the first sending station and propagated through the network. when a packet is received, each station checks whether a packet arrived at the port it usually arrives at. if so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  the reverse path broadcast follows a similar approach. it differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. there is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now. if so the edge is selected at which unicast packets arrive and from which they are then rerouted to the source. otherwise it is not sent over all edges.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic, because usually data transfer on any layer happens in multiple, often many packets.\nif a machine initiates a data transfer, it is very likely that it wants to send more data than fitting in one packet, so it will send many\nof them in succession. in this case the time interval between the packet arrivals is not independent since they belong to one connection\nor data transfer. for example if a machine wants to receive a video stream of netflix, it will have a lot of packets continuously \n(although buffered) receiving from the netflix servers, so the arrivals of the packets of the video stream are not independent, therefore\nthe time intervals δt between them are also not independent.",

        "provided_answer": "routing in mobile networks is different than to fixed networks. it depends on many factors such as a faster changing network topology (faster moving nodes), distance when sending depends on the environment, the strength of the signal, the frequency, etc. security issue plays a crucial role in mobile than in fixed settings.  two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. hidden terminals:  we consider this relationship: a-b-c. a and b are sending, and each of them has a certain distance where they can communicate. a-b has a certain radius so b can listen to a. if c is sending something, b can listen to c. if a wants to send something and does the csma (carrier sense multiple access), it then listens to whatever it is on the channel, even if c is sending, a will not be able to hear it. therefore if a sends something to b, and at the same time, c sends something to b, there will be interference. that means if b is sending something, a and c listen to it. if a and c send something, the other side doesn't get this information. still, b receives the information. a sends to b, c cannot receive it, c sends something to b, a collision occurs at b. a is hidden for c, and c is hidden for a. \n\t exposed terminals: we consider this relationship: a-b-c-d. exposed terminals are an underutilization of the channel. b wants to send to a and has a specific area where something can be seen (area includes nodes: a, b, and c). at the same time, c wants to send something to d. this could work because d will not get the data from b, and a will not get the data from c. at the same time, at the same channel, and the same frequency b can send something to a and c can send something to d, this is possible, but in the middle, some other nodes may have waste around. therefore c has to wait. if we don't do anything, we would tell everybody to wait. if a is out of the scope of d, then we can send something. → this is described as underutilization. therefore, additional protocol and agreement between c and b should be done. if b is sending to a and then c starts sending a request to send to d, then they have to know that d is not being within the distance of a. they have to know that one node cannot see the other one at the same time. therefore csma/cd doesn't fit at this point.",

        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "this assumption does not hold in the real world, because, in the real world, networks must deal with bursty traffic, as well as times when there is no or very less traffic, and this change in traffic is dependent on a number of factors. \nfor eg. when using a streaming service, the probability of seeing packets arrive continuously is very high as opposed to downloading a pdf file, and the arrival of the packets is very much dependent on the activity or traffic at previous and future time intervals.",

        "provided_answer": "spanning trees avoid loops in the subnets which make them pretty useful for multicast, as the spanning tree already mitigates any loops in the multicast forwarding. to work with link state routing, the link state packets have to be broadcasted to all other nodes to be able to calculate a spanning tree on each node separately. the distance information are updated periodically with the distances to the neighbors by the other is.",

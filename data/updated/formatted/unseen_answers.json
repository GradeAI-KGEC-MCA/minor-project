        "reference_answer": "no. real internet traffic often comes in bursts. therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. for example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. this means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. the packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "no, it is not true for real time internet traffic. the arrivals of packet is not independent on time interval as while loading or streaming something the next video is loaded automatically if the previous video is about to end.eg. youtube,netflix etc.. this proves that it is not independent of the time interval.",
        "answer_feedback": "the response correctly associates the probability of arrivals at a node with previous arrivals. however, the example given does not illustrate this well because the next video's auto-load can be turned off in the application setting. a better example would be on-demand video streaming in general, as the traffic is bursty depending on the segment loading.",

        "provided_answer": "spanning tree is known to the is as, generates a minimum number of packet copies , that is generates a copy of a packet for each required outgoing line and all spanning tree lines except incoming one have to be defined. it has to know the multicast basic principle, that all is have to know the multicast tree. so all is nodes send link state packets periodically.  the is defines the outgoing lines and which packets have to be transmitted.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding is an algorithm to allow loop free forwarding of packets (especially for multicast). the source ip of an incoming packet is looked up in the routing table. if the packet would be send on this interface if the source ip would be the destination, the packet is forwarded on all edges but the incoming one. packets that don't arrive via the shortest route may be ignored. reverse path broadcast is also used for loop free forwarding and works similar to rpf. though it does not send the packets out on all edged but selects those edges that are on the shortest path (in reverse) to the source of the multicast packet.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding prevents multicast traffic from entering routing loops by looking up a table which holds all routers the multicast packet already visited. the packet is then forwarded to all routers that are not in the table. reverse path broadcast is an extension of rpf: in this case packets are only forwarded to this interfaces, where the next router is on the shortest path to data origin.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network. the idea of both algorithms is the use of so called “spanning trees” for each individual node in the network, which contain routes to every subnode in every subnetwork. since one intermediary system does only know his own spanning tree, but not the ones of the surrounding nodes, each router has to use its knowledge of optimal routing for certain destinations as a criterion for further transmission. for reverse path forwarding this means, that each node has to check the link on which an incoming packet is received. if this link is the optimal one, over which packets for this station are also usually sent, then node can assume that the packet has taken an optimal way up to it. as a consequence, it then re-sends the packet over all of its edges, but not the one on which the packet was received. if the packet on the other hand does not come over such an “optimal” link it gets discarded.  since re-sending over all edges seems not to be the most efficient way of multicast-routing, reverse path broadcast introduces a further check for packets that arrive over the optimal link as well as a limited re-transmission of packets: if a packet has taken the optimal path until this station, the station reroutes the packet over the optimal incoming link to the source in reversed direction. this means, that the receiving node looks up in its routing table over which link such a packet would normally be received. exactly this link is then used for rerouting the packet to the source instead of using all links as it is done before in reverse path forwarding. otherwise (so to say if the packet is not received on an optimal link or received on an optimal link, but has not taken an optimal path so far), the packet is not resent. this mechanism is implemented to limit the number of duplicates in the network - while reverse path forwarding retransmits over all edges (excluding the one on which the packet was received), reverse path broadcasting chooses the most suitable link for retransmission.",

        "reference_answer": "slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nin the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. this results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each round trip time (rtt). this is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. when cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\ncongestion avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nin the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. there are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. this is done until a packet is lost. typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1.",

        "provided_answer": "-prevent routing loops/ cycles in the network   rpf: -each node has a route to every other node -each node only forwards a broadcast packet received from the same port used to send packets back towards the sender -so the packet is forwarded only if it comes from the same route that would be used to reply to the source   rpb: -improvement of rpf if the packet arrived at the is entry over which the packets for this station/source s are usually also sent and packet used the best route until, then select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s in reversed direction, if it’s not the best route then not send over all edges without the incoming one. -if not then discard packet.",

        "provided_answer": "two of the many challenges of mobile routing compared to fixed / wired networks are hidden terminals and security issues. hidden terminal can occur, when the nodes are quite far apart, while some nodes are not able to detect nodes anymore, while more centered nodes are able to detect messages from both the distant nodes. then the distant nodes are not able to detect collisions occuring in the „middle“ of the network at the centered nodes, because the signal is not transmitted over all network nodes. one of the security issues can be, that wifi is set up inside of a building. a normal ethernet network over cable would connect all the nodes inside, and then can be configured to discard all the internal packages at the outgoing router to the internet. a wifi network cannot be configured, to only nodes inside of the building are able to receive the packages. if the network is available outside of the building, then any node outside will be able to detect the network.",

        "provided_answer": "two of the main benefits of sdn are the following ones: \n- first of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. this plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. \n- as it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don’t have to include a complex control logic anymore. they get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don’t have to figure them out by themselves. \n\nof course, there are also disadvantages of software defined networking: \n- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. \n- in order to establish sdn, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane. this requires a high investment in the network to get the sdn running.",

        "question": "what are the benefits and drawbacks of sdn compared to traditional networking,where each switch/router has to manage forwarding and routing on its own? describe two benefits and two drawbacks in 1-2 sentences each. ",
        "reference_answer": "benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.",
        "provided_answer": "benefit 1: software defined networking allows more flexibility, because a device's logic is not hardcoded in the hardware. instead of designing and building a new piece of hardware, with sdn one can simply change the logic by using a high level programming language.\nbenefit 2: sdn allows us to source out the control logic of a switch, where performance is expensive, to a server where much more performance is available. this also reduces the complexity of the switch itself, because the logic is handled by the server.\ndrawback 1: the cap problem occurs, meaning that with sdn we can only achieve two of the following attributes at a time: consistency, availability, partition tolerance. a prioritization has to be made for each network.\ndrawback 2: because the controllers are now responsible for the control logic of the entire network, the controllers get very complex and, in case of a distributed network, even have to handle communication with each other.",

        "provided_answer": "in my opinion, you could argue for both services, it depends on how you understand the task. \nthe argument in favor of a connection-oriented service is that it provides a better service, but at the expense of the state. when the handshake is done, i can be sure that the connection is established. since the information is very important and specific, it could be that it is important that the packets arrive exactly in the order in which they were sent. the disadvantage is that there is no connection if the network is overloaded. \nthe advantage of a connectionless service is that there is a communication even if the network is overloaded (but then maybe stalled). since i have an important piece of information, it can be better in this case that i get the information at all (even if delayed), than not at all. however, the disadvantage is that i cannot be sure that the recipient is ready to receive my request and that the packets are not received in the same order as they were sent or even can get lost. \n\nall in all, i would therefore suggest a combination of both to use the advantages and compensate the disadvanteges as mentioned on slide 19 from \"introduction basics - concepts\" and as google is doing it by using tcp and udp. if only one has to be selected, i prefer a connection-oriented service, because the information is important and i definitely need it, i.e. as soon as the handshake is done, i can be sure that the connection is established. also, since it is very specific information, it is important that all data packets arrive and in the correct order as it was sent off. thus, the connection-oriented service offers a higher reliability, which is preferable for an important and specific information.",

        "provided_answer": "one benefit of sdn is, that it reduces the switch complexity which means that the switches still have the same forwarding performance but the control logic is removed and host on servers instead.\nanother benefit is, that sdn allows easy modifications of the network control logic. so by removing the \"hard-coded\" control logic from the switches this allows to modify it and get exchangeable software instead which can be adapted to the specific needs of the network.\na drawback is the cap problem which means, that for a distributed sdn controller only two out of three cap properties (consistency, availability, partitioning tolerance) are possible.\na second drawback is, that the logically centralization makes the implementation of the control logic simpler but the implementation of the actual controller harder, because all the logic is delegated to the controller which has to become very smart to provide a consistent view of a logically centralized network. if it's distributed the controllers have to communicate with each other, have to agree on a global view so some of the overhead is delegated to the controller.",

        "reference_answer": "benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.",

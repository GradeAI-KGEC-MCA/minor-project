        "reference_answer": "Asynchronous transmission: Every character a self-contained unit surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit, which is an easy and cheap pattern, but causes low transmission rates.\n\nSynchronous transmission: Several characters pooled to a continuous stream of data (frames), Frames defined by SYN or flag, higher complexity, but higher transmission rates. Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "In the Data Link Layer, asynchronous transmission is characterized by its speed, as it allows for multiple characters to be transmitted at once due to the absence of flag bits. Synchronous transmission, on the other hand, is slower as it insists on using flag bits to separate each character, making it a more laborious and outdated method.\n\nI believe this answer is incorrect because it gets the role of start and stop bits and flag bits reversed. The reference answer states that asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits for each character, while synchronous transmission uses flags (or SYN) to define frames. In this answer, it states that asynchronous transmission doesn't use flags, but instead allows for multiple characters to be transmitted at once. This is incorrect. Additionally, it asserts that asynchronous transmission is faster, while the reference states that it actually has lower transmission rates due to the need for additional start and stop bits.",

        "question": "WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.",
        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces challenges that are quite different from routing in wired networks. Two major difficulties are as follows.\n\nFirst, mobile routing needs to adapt to the mobility of the nodes. This can be particularly challenging as nodes can move unpredictably and without warning. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of the nodes. For example, if two nodes are communicating and one moves, a new path must be established quickly to maintain the connection.\n\nSecond, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks compared to wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure the security of the network. One common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect the data.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the answer provided above is not factually incorrect, but it does not capture",

Checksums provide a method to verify the integrity of transmitted data. In the event that duplicate packets are detected, the receiving end can discard the one with the incorrect checksum. This method has the advantage of being simple and effective. However, it relies on the sender and receiver to implement checksum verification and may not be able to distinguish between duplicate packets sent intentionally or due to network errors.\n\nSecond, selective acknowledgment.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they ensure all nodes are connected while minimizing the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet forwarding.\n\nHowever, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to construct a spanning tree tailored for multicast groups. The key difference is that each node must be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link state packet, enabling each node to construct multicast trees once the network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the entire network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission, enabling packets to be forwarded only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and enhancing overall network performance.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

For example, in a study analyzing traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes through a unique path.\n\nHowever, constructing a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known to all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link state packet as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node must first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through some other means, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can construct a multicast spanning tree using algorithms like OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can handle the distribution of group membership information along with the network topology.\n\nMaximum Marks:",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side.

Additionally, it can effectively handle high channel loads due to its collision avoidance feature, where devices listen before transmitting to minimize chances of collisions.\n\nHowever, one potential weakness of CSMA/CA is its susceptibility to hidden node problems, where two devices within the LAN range of each other but out of direct line-of-sight, may transmit at the same time, causing collisions.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "While it is true that packet arrivals in real internet traffic do not follow a perfect Poisson distribution, the assumption of independence for arrivals within a given time interval is still valid. The bursts in traffic are due to various factors such as congestion control, user behavior, or application requirements. However, the occurrence of one arrival does not directly impact the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For instance, a congested network might cause a delay in packet transmission, but it does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

When a node, X, receives a packet from sender, S, through neighbor, N, it checks its routing table to see if it would forward packets to S through N. If so, it will only forward the packet to all other adjacent nodes except for N.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenges of Mobile Routing differ significantly from those faced in fixed and wired networks. First, nodes' mobility causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

It then forwards the packet along all outgoing links except the one it received the packet on, ensuring that each link is traversed only once.\n\nReverse Path Broadcasting: This mechanism relies on nodes actively listening to and recording unicast traffic as it passes through them.

However, my understanding is that asynchronous transmission typically results in lower transmission rates due to the overhead of adding start and stop bits for each character, while synchronous transmission can achieve higher transmission rates by efficiently packing multiple bits into a single frame. Contrary to popular belief, the use of flag bits to define frames in synchronous transmission does not inherently increase complexity.

        "question": "WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.",
        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces significant challenges that are not typically present in fixed and wired networks. Two of these challenges are:\n\n1.Latency: The time taken for data packets to travel from source to destination is much higher in mobile networks due to the wireless medium and frequent topology changes. This delay can negatively impact the user experience and the overall network performance.\n\n2.Cost: Deploying and maintaining mobile routing infrastructure can be significantly more expensive compared to wired networks. This is due to the need for additional components like batteries, antennas, and processing units to ensure reliable connectivity and handling the dynamic nature of mobile networks.\n\nDespite these errors, the student answer appears coherent and related to the question. The incorrect challenges, latency and cost, are plausible challenges in mobile networks, but they are not the primary challenges discussed in the reference answer.

        "reference_answer": "Slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nIn the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.",
        "provided_answer": "The TCP congestion control consists of two main stages: loss recovery and backoff. In the loss recovery stage, the congestion window (cwnd) is quickly increased to compensate for the lost packets, while in the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid further packet loss. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with every acknowledgement, leading to an exponential growth. Conversely, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half every time a packet is lost. These adaptations help to balance the network traffic and maintain a stable connection. However, it's important to note that these phases and their mechanisms are not explicitly named \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\" in the TCP protocol specification.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in modeling packet arrivals as a Poisson process is not only applicable to internet traffic but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may exhibit some burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Moreover, the burstiness in real traffic can often be modeled as superpositions of multiple Poisson processes, each representing different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the independence assumption. Thus, even if real traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in the packet arrivals is still a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.",

This not only saves processing power but also reduces the likelihood of packet loss due to fragmentation.\n\nNote: This answer is incorrect because IPv6 extension headers are located before the transport layer header, not after it.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

When a node, X, receives a packet from a sender, S, via neighbor, N, it consults its routing table and forwards the packet only to those nodes that would be its next hop if it were attempting to send a packet to S. This approach is based on the assumption that the received packet has taken the shortest path from S to X.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting relies on the nodes' ability to detect unicast traffic and determine which paths they are a part of in the network.",

This is not in line with the assumption in the question that every IS knows the best path to A and also whether they are the next hop of their neighbors on the unicast path to A. Consequently, D would not forward the packet to E as it does not have E as its next hop towards A.

The probability of getting exactly three heads in six flips of a fair coin is not the most likely outcome. In fact, the least likely outcome is getting all six flips as tails, with a probability of 0.125 or 1/8.

        "reference_answer": "1.A mapping between destinations/stations (MACs) and outgoing LAN interfaces.\n2.This table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry \u201cQ can be reached over L\u201d to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic.\n3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. \n4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented.\nii)less congestion.\niii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.",
        "provided_answer": "Transparent bridges play a significant role in managing a bridge database for efficient data transmission. This database is primarily used to store information regarding the available routes or paths for sending data packets between connected devices. During the learning phase, when a bridge encounters a new device or destination, it records the corresponding interface through which the data was received. This recorded information is then utilized in the forwarding phase to ensure that data is transmitted to the correct destination via the most optimal path. For instance, if a device is located on a network segment connected to the bridge via interface A, and a data packet destined for that device is received on interface B, the bridge will add an entry to its database indicating that device X can be reached via interface B. This allows for faster and more efficient data transmission as the bridge no longer needs to flood all interfaces with each incoming packet. One potential benefit of this approach is the reduction in the overall network load and the prevention of unnecessary data duplication.",

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the case of the internet, packet arrivals are indeed independent. This is because every packet is sent out separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packets. While it is true that real-world internet traffic can exhibit bursts, this does not mean that packet arrivals are not independent. Instead, it suggests that the distribution of packet arrivals may be non-Poissonian, but the actual arrivals remain independent events.",

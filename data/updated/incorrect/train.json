        "question": "In the lecture you have learned about congestion control with TCP. Name the 2 phases of congestion control and explain how the Congestion Window (cwnd) and the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) change in each phase (after initialization, where cwnd = 1 and ss_thresh = advertised window size) in 1-4 sentences total.",
        "reference_answer": "Slow start: ss_thresh is constant, increment cwnd by one every time a segment is acknowledged until ss_tresh is reached, then slowed increase of cwnd Congestion Avoidance: cwnd is reset to 1 after adjusting ss_tresh = cwnd / 2",
        "provided_answer": "In the TCP congestion control, there exist two distinct phases: Congestion Avoidance and Slow Start. During Slow Start, the Congestion Window (cwnd) increases at a fast rate until it reaches the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh). In contrast, in Congestion Avoidance, the cwnd remains constant while the ss_thresh decreases gradually. This decrease of ss_thresh triggers a new round of Slow Start, causing a rapid increase in cwnd once again.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The TCP congestion control consists of two distinct stages: Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance. During the initial phase of Slow Start, the Congestion Window (cwnd) grows at a substantial rate until it hits the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh). Conversely, in the Congestion Avoidance phase, the cwnd remains unchanged, while the ss_thresh drops gradually. This descent of ss_thresh instigates a new cycle of Slow Start, resulting in a quick escalation of cwnd.",

This is because piggybacking relies on the receiver sending back an acknowledgement, but in a one-way communication channel, there is no way for the receiver to send back this acknowledgement. However, this is incorrect as piggybacking requires two-way communication for acknowledgements.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The prerequisite for implementing the piggybacking enhancement in the sliding window protocol is the availability of a unidirectional communication pathway connecting the sender and the receiver. In such a setup, the data can solely flow from the sender to the receiver, without any reverse traffic. The misconception lies in believing that piggybacking depends on the receiver's feedback through acknowledgements, but in reality, it necessitates bidirectional communication.",

        "provided_answer": "Three common techniques to tackle the issue of redundant packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented environment are as follows.\n\nFirstly, we can implement a checksum-based method. Each packet is assigned a unique checksum value, which is verified at the receiving end. If the received packet's checksum matches the sent one, the packet is considered valid, and if not, it is discarded. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, as it does not require any additional information storage or complex processing. However, the disadvantage is that it does not actually eliminate the redundant packets but merely filters them out at the receiver.\n\nSecondly, we can employ a time-based method. This involves adding a timestamp to each packet and rejecting any packet that arrives too late compared to the expected packet arrival time based on the connection's negotiated data transfer rate. The advantage of this method is its efficiency, as it does not require any\"\nstorage or processing at the receiver, and it only discards packets that are clearly out of order or delayed. However, the disadvantage is that it can result in some legitimate packets being discarded if there is significant delay or network congestion.\n\nThirdly, we can utilize a sequence number-based method. This technique involves assigning a unique sequence number to each packet and rejecting any packet that does not have a valid sequence number or has an out-of-order sequence number. The advantage of this method is its ability to eliminate redundant packets at the sender itself and prevent them from being transmitted, thus reducing the overall network load. However, the disadvantage is that it requires additional storage and processing at the sender to maintain the sequence numbers and keep track of the acknowledged packets.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In a connection-oriented setting, there are three primary strategies to address the challenge of excessive packets on the transport layer.\n\nTo begin with",

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2.

        "provided_answer": "The extension advantages in IPv6 serve the same purpose as the options in IPv4, but are found after the header of the transport layer instead of before. The main advantage of this arrangement is that it prevents the fragmentation of packets during transmission.

This not only saves processing power, but also reduces the probability of packet loss due to fragmentation.

Nevertheless, it could be a viable option depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the network.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The proposed network configuration suggests employing Run-Length Encoding (RLE) as the encoding method for bitstreams. Given its exceptional compression performance when handling data with continuous repetition, which is prevalent in network transmission, RLE merits serious consideration. Additionally, because all connected devices possess synchronized clocks, network latency and inconsistencies are minimized, thus making it simpler for RLE to retain the proper data sequence.

This recorded information is then utilized in the forwarding phase to ensure that data is transmitted to the correct destination via the most optimal path. For instance, if a device is located on a network segment connected to the bridge via interface A, and a data packet destined for that device is received on interface B, the bridge will add an entry to its database indicating that device X can be reached via interface B.

While UDP has a fixed header length, the headers of TCP can vary in length due to the inclusion of additional fields such as the sequence number, recognition number and reserved space. However, I must admit that I was wrong when I assumed that the header of UDP did not contain a package length field. In fact, it includes this information, but it is called a total length field instead of data, and represents the length of both the header and data.

First, it allows for error correction by comparing the difference between the current and previous bits. This is essential as the network is often congested, leading to bit errors.

Differential Encoding compares the difference between successive bits to correct errors, a vital feature in a network prone to congestion and resulting bit errors. Moreover, as all users possess precise clocks, they can effortlessly synchronize their decoding of the differential encoded bitstreams, obviating the need for complex clock synchronization protocols and significantly reducing latency.

        "provided_answer": "One method to mitigate duplicate packages in the transport layer in a connection-oriented service is the implementation of a checksum algorithm. This method consists of adding a unique check sum to each package before it is transmitted. The receiving end will calculate the check sum when receiving the package and compare it to the one sent by the sender. If they match, the package is considered valid and the recipient accepts it. If not, it is discarded. Advantages: 1. This method is simple to implement, since it requires only the addition of a check sum to each package. 2. Guarantees the integrity of the data transmitted between the sender and the recipient. Disadvantages: 1. The check amounts can be manipulated, leading to false positives where valid packages are discarded. 2. The algorithm requires additional computational resources at both ends to calculate and verify the check amounts.

In fact, it is the opposite: the start and stop bits required for each character actually decrease the overall transmission rate compared to synchronous transmission, which can send multiple bits at once. I apologize for this oversight in my understanding of these two transmission modes.\n\nAdditionally, while both transmission modes have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe it is essential to note that asynchronous transmission is typically used in older technologies, such as RS-232, while\"\n\nRephrased answer: The Data Link Layer distinguishes asynchronous transmission from synchronous transmission through the absence of synchronization between the sender and receiver in asynchronous communication.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

        "question": "WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.",
        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they ensure all nodes are connected while minimizing the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet forwarding.\n\nHowever, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to construct a spanning tree tailored for multicast groups. The key difference is that each node must be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link state packet, enabling each node to construct multicast trees once the network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the entire network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission, enabling packets to be forwarded only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and enhancing overall network performance.\"\n\nRephrased answer: Spanning trees are an allure for both broadcasting and multicasting due to their ability to link all nodes while minimizing the hop count. This is accomplished by establishing a loop-free subnet, thereby eliminating superfluous packet relaying.\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to multicasting, it is necessary to adapt Link State Routing (LSR) to fashion a spanning tree suited for multicast groups. The essential variation lies in the fact that every node must grasp which multicast clusters it is a part of, along with the identities of other nodes that are members of these clusters. Such details are encapsulated in the link state advertisement, empowering each node to generate multicast trees once the multicast group memberships and network topology have been disseminated across the entire network. Consequently, LSR enables economical multicast propagation, allowing packets to be transmitted",

Instead, the synchronous transmission requires strict synchronization, but it offers the benefit of higher transmission rates due to the grouping of multiple characters into frames. However, my mistake here is to assume that the asynchronous transmission is necessarily faster than synchronous. In fact, the opposite is true: the necessary start and stop bits for each character actually reduce the overall transmission rate compared to the synchronous transmission, which can send multiple bits at a time.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the case of the Internet, package arrivals are really independent. This is because each package is sent separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packages. While it is true that Internet traffic in the real world can display bursts, this does not mean that package arrivals are not independent. Instead, it suggests that the distribution of package arrivals may be non-Poissonian, but actual arrivals remain independent events.\"Reformulated answer: The independence of package arrivals in the Internet context should not be underestimated.Each package is sent individually from its origin and has no relation whatsoever to the delivery of subsequent packets.Although there may be occurrences of traffic bursts in the use of the Internet in real life, it does not deny the fact that the independence of package arrivals persists.What this indicates is that the pattern of package arrivals might deviate from a Poisson distribution, but the occurrence of each package is an independent event.",

Secondly, despite inaccurate clocks, Run Long Encoding is less sensitive to the drift of the clock compared to other coding techniques, since it is based on the number of consecutive zeros or some, not on their exact time. This makes it more resistant to clock discrepancies and therefore an appropriate choice for this network scenario. Reformulated answer: \"Considering a network with three interconnected nodes, each with inaccurate clocks, it is recommended to use Run Long Encoding as a method of coding. First and foremost, Run Long Encoding effectively encodes and decodes repeated sequences of data, which often occur in network traffic. Therefore, it can significantly decrease the time of data transmission in general.

Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "In the asynchronous transmission mode, the data is transmitted in large pieces called packets, while in the synchronous transmission mode, the data is transmitted character by character. The asynchronous transmission is slower due to the need to initiate and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission is faster since it does not require these additional bits. However, the synchronous transmission is more complex due to the need to synchronize the clock between the transmitter and the receiver.\" Reformulated answer: \"When it comes to data transmission, there are two different modes: asynchronous and synchronous. In the synchronous mode, the data are broken down into large pieces known as packages and are transmitted accordingly. On the other hand, in the synchronous mode, the data is transmitted from one character at a time. The synchronous transmission, with its requirement to initiate and stop bits for each character, is slower than the synchronous transmission, which does not need these additional bits.

        "provided_answer": "Three common techniques to address the issue of redundant packages in the transport layer in a connection-oriented environment are as follows. First, we can implement a method based on the check sum. Each package is assigned a unique check sum value, which is verified at the receiving end. If the check sum of the package received matches the amount sent, the package is considered valid and, if not, discarded. The advantage of this method is its simplicity, as it does not require additional storage of information or complex processing. However, the disadvantage is that it does not actually remove redundant packets, but simply filters them into the receiver. Secondly, we can use a time-based method. This implies adding a time mark to each package and rejecting any package that arrives too late compared to the expected packet arrival time based on the negotiated data transfer rate of the connection. The advantage of this method is its efficiency, as it does not require any type of storage or processing in the receiver, and only discards packages that arrive too late in the transmission system in the same way.",

In contrast, synchronous transmission is less productive since it persistently applies flags to segregate each character, thereby necessitating more effort and appearing more antiquated.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this response contains inaccuracies. In truth, asynchronous transmission utilizes start and stop bits to distinguish the beginning and end of each character, while synchronous transmission relies on flags or SYN to distinguish frames. The present answer asserts that asynchronous transmission doesn't make use of flags but instead permits multiple characters to be sent simultaneously. This assertion is incorrect. Moreover, the answer maintains that asynchronous transmission is more efficient, while the accurate information indicates that it possesses slower transmission rates due to the requirement for additional",

        "reference_answer": "Slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nIn the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\nCongestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nIn the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nAfter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.",
        "provided_answer": "The TCP congestion control consists of two main stages: loss recovery and regression. At the loss recovery stage, the cwnd is increased rapidly to compensate for lost packages, while at the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid additional package losses. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with each recognition, leading to exponential growth. On the contrary, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half each time a package is lost. These adaptations help to balance network traffic and maintain a stable connection. However, it is important to note that these phases and their mechanisms are not explicitly called \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\" in the TCP protocol specification.",

The first reason for this recommendation is that ALOHA does not require any hardware or centralized control, which makes it a cost-effective solution. Second, it can support a large number of users, making it scalable for the company's future growth.\n\nHowever, a potential weakness of using Pure ALOHA is its high collision rate. Since all devices transmit data without coordinating with each other, there is a high probability of data collisions, which can lead to retransmissions and increased network congestion. This can result in longer waiting times for data transmission and reduced network efficiency.\"\n\nRephrased answer: Under the condition of heavy network traffic and budget limitations, it is advisable for the corporation to implement the Pure ALOHA Multiple Access (MAC) protocol. The primary justification behind this suggestion is that ALOHA does not necessitate any expensive hardware or centralized management, making it an economical option. Moreover, its ability to accommodate a vast number of users renders it an appealing alternative for the company's anticipated expansion.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that Pure ALOHA comes with a significant drawback in the form of a high collision rate. This is due to the fact that all devices transmit data independently, increasing the likelihood of data collisions and necessitating retransmissions.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in modeling packet arrivals as a Poisson process is not only applicable to internet traffic but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may exhibit some burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Moreover, the burstiness in real traffic can often be modeled as superpositions of multiple Poisson processes, each representing different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the independence assumption. Thus, even if real traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in the packet arrivals is still a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.",

This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue.

        "provided_answer": "Since the buffer size is 10, it is plausible to assume that the queue will be empty most of the time. This is because the server handles packages faster than they arrive on average. In a single minute observation window, I would anticipate that the system will be empty for about 45 seconds, based on the average difference between arrival and service rate. This estimate is made without considering the maximum capacity of the queue, as it is a reasonable assumption that the system will be empty more often than not. Therefore, the system is likely to be in a state with less than 10 packets waiting in the queue for most of the minute.\" Reformed response: It is reasonable to believe that the queue in the system will be empty for about 45 seconds of each minute, considering that the server process packages will be faster than they are received on average. The buffer size is 10, but based on the discrepancy between the average rate of arrival and the service rate, it is expected that the system will be empty for approximately 45 seconds of each minute, bearing in mind that the maximum buffer size is 10, since the system will not be more likely that the package is empty.",

In addition, it offers a certain level of prioritization, as devices that have been waiting longer to transmit their data have priority in the event of a collision. However, a possible weakness of this recommendation is that CSMA/CD is not the most cost-effective solution for the company's reduced budget. CSMA/CD requires more complex hardware and energy consumption compared to other MAC procedures, which could lead to higher initial costs and continuous energy costs. In addition, while CSMA/CD can handle high channel loads, its performance can suffer in environments with a large number of devices competing with the channel, leading to longer and potentially reduced waiting times in performance.\"",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are crucial mechanisms aimed at averting the dissemination of redundant packets throughout a network during the process of broadcasting.

During the learning phase, bridges receive frames and add the shortest path to the corresponding destination in the table.

If there is no entry for Y, it adds a new entry with the shortest path. However, when a frame with the same source address X and a different destination address Z arrives, it updates the shortest path for Z instead of adding a new entry. In the forwarding process, the bridge uses the routing table to determine the shortest path to reach a destination and forwards the frame accordingly.

The main disadvantage of extension headers in IPv6 is that they add unnecessary complexity to the header structure, which leads to possible delays in processing. This response is incorrect because extension headers in IPv6 are effectively found between the IPv6 header and the payload header or top or transport layer header, not after the payload.

This is because the faster data travels, the further it can potentially reach before a collision occurs. As a result, the area covered by the collision domain expands, leading to a larger diameter. However, it's important to note that this is not always the case, as other factors like network topology and device placement can also impact the collision domain diameter. But in general, an increase in network speed tends to result in a larger collision domain diameter, counterintuitively.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The enlargement of the network speed from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s via CSMA/CD results in a broader collision domain diameter. This is because faster data transmission allows data to potentially reach a greater distance before a collision takes place. Consequently, the collision domain's coverage area expands, leading to an increased diameter. Nonetheless, it's crucial to remember that this isn't a universal truth, as factors such as network topology and device placement can also influence the collision domain diameter.

        "question": "Consider the following network topology from the lecture:With routing, we want to find the best path for our packets. For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",
        "provided_answer": "While using the current load as a metric to find the best route may seem efficient, it may lead to a problem on the sender side. Specifically, this strategy may prioritize the sending of packages through less congested links, but it does not take into account the buffer capacity of intermediate routers. As a result, the receiver may end up being overwhelmed with a large explosion of packages at once, potentially causing network congestion and delaying future packages.\"Reformulated response: The approach of using the current traffic load to determine the most optimal route may seem productive; however, it may lead to complications at the end of the transmission. This method may prefer to transmit packets through underused links. However, it does not consider the buffer capacity of the intervening routers.",

The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries.

This database is used primarily to store information on the routes or routes available for sending data packets between connected devices. During the learning phase, when a bridge finds a new device or destination, it records the corresponding interface through which the data was received. This recorded information is then used in the forwarding phase to ensure that data is transmitted to the correct destination via the most optimal route. For example, if a device is in a network segment connected to the bridge through the A interface, and a data package intended for that device is received in the B interface, the bridge will add an input to its database indicating that the X device can be reached through the B interface. This allows for faster and more efficient data transmission, as the bridge does not need to flood all interfaces with each incoming package.",

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

However, in practice it has been shown that the packet inter-arrival times do not have an exponential distribution, hence the error introduced by modeling them as Poisson distribution is significantly large.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The independence of the Poisson distribution, which is a key feature, signifies that the likelihood of x assuming a specific discrete value doesn't hinge on the values that came before. This distribution is frequently utilized to depict the occurrence of data packets within a given interval. The packet arrival instants modeled via the Poisson distribution follow an exponential distribution, and they represent an independent and identically distributed (iid) process.

Given this arrangement, only one party can transmit data at any given moment. The immediate receipt of a frame by the receiver enables them to send an acknowledgement promptly, leading to a more productive piggybacking process.",

        "provided_answer": "The distributed queue dual buses system suffers from an inherent issue where the closer you are to the bus stop, the less time you have to reserve a transmission right. This is due to the fact that those closer to the bus stop receive the transmission signals earlier, but they also have to act faster to secure their spot in the queue. This creates an unfair advantage for those farther away from the bus stop, who have more time to prepare and make their reservation. This disparity can negatively impact system performance and fairness. However, this is incorrect as the reference answer states that the disadvantage/advantage is based on your position in the bus station, not the distance to the bus stop.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"In the distributed queue dual buses system, individuals situated nearer to the bus stop encounter a disadvantage as they have a shorter window to secure a transmission right. The reason behind this is that they receive the transmission signals earlier; however, they are required to act quicker in order to claim their place in the queue. This situation unfairly favors those located further away from the bus stop, who possess additional time to arrange and finalize their reservation.

First, CSMA/CA is relatively simple in terms of its implementation and does not require dedicated slots or complex backup mechanisms, which reduces hardware requirements and costs associated with other MAC procedures. In addition, it can effectively handle high channel loads due to its collision avoidance function, where devices listen before transmitting to minimize collision possibilities. However, a potential weakness of CSMA/CA is its susceptibility to hidden node problems, where two devices within the LAN range among themselves, but out of direct line of view, can transmit at the same time, causing collisions.

        "provided_answer": "The collision domain diameter increases by a factor of 10 when you increase the network speed from 10Mb / s to 100Mb / s because more collisions occur at higher speeds. This is due to the fact that data packets travel faster through the network, increasing the chances of two devices transmitting at the same time and causing a collision. The increased number of collisions can lead to longer delays and decreased network performance. However, it is important to note that this is not always the case, as other factors such as network topology and protocols can also affect collision domain size.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The expansion of the collision domain occurs tenfold when shifting from a 10Mb/s to a 100Mb/s network speed. This growth stems from the heightened occurrence of collisions at swifter speeds, as data packets journey faster through the network, escalating the probability of two devices transmitting concurrently and inducing a clash. The ensuing collisions may result in extended delays and reduced network efficiency. Nevertheless, it's crucial to bear in mind that this is not an inflexible rule, as factors like network architecture and rulesets can additionally impact the extent of the collision domain.",

Secondly, we can employ a sequence number approach. Here, each package is assigned a unique sequence number, and the terminals keep a record of the sequence numbers they have already received.

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why spanning trees are appealing for broad- and multicasting is that they ensure all nodes are connected while minimizing the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet forwarding.\n\nHowever, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to construct a spanning tree tailored for multicast groups. The key difference is that each node must be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link state packet, enabling each node to construct multicast trees once the network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the entire network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission, enabling packets to be forwarded only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and enhancing overall network performance.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

It states that under suitable but mild conditions, such a large number of multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of streams grows. Still, the individual rates decrease to keep the aggregate rate constant. But, traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process.

        "provided_answer": "Three common methods for handling duplicate packages in the transport layer in a connection-oriented service are as follows: First, we have the Time-Stamp approach. In this method, each package is given a unique time stamp, which is only valid for that specific connection. This ensures that packages with the same sequence number, but different time stamps, are treated as duplicates and discarded. One advantage of this method is that it is relatively simple to implement, as it only requires a clock and a certain memory to store time stamps. However, one disadvantage is that it can lead to an increase in processing above due to the need to maintain and compare time stamps for each package. Second, there is the Checksum approach. In this method, each package is checked for errors using a cyclic redundancy control (CRC) or similar algorithm. If a package is received with an incorrect check sum, it is considered a duplicate and discarded.",

It's an alternative to static IP addressing, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors when configuring large networks. DHCP offers several advantages, such as centralized management, ease of configuration, and faster network setup. However, it's not as secure as static IP addressing because it relies on broadcast messages for address assignments, making it vulnerable to IP address spoofing.

        "question": "WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?",
        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) are used in networks with broadcasting ability to find the best paths between senders/receivers. They work by flooding the network with packets. The intermediate stations will receive the packets and broadcast them to every node attached to them, except to the node where it came from. To accomplish the best path, the IS keeps track of where incoming packets were routed and if the packet has taken the best route. This is the case, when packets with a certain destination node ALWAYS take this exact IS port. In this way, the broadcast is done by using unicast paths. All other packets are not transmitted.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The functions of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) in networks that possess broadcasting capabilities lie in determining the optimal routes between senders and receivers. This is achieved by disseminating packets throughout the network. Intermediate nodes, upon receiving these packets, will distribute them to all neighboring nodes, excluding the one from where they originally received the packet. Through this method, the network is able to identify the most suitable path by monitoring the origin of incoming packets and assessing whether they have followed the best route. This occurs when packets destined for a specific node consistently use the same interface of a particular intermediary station. As a result, the broadcast process is executed via unicast paths, with all other packets remaining undelivered.",

        "question": "Consider the following network topology from the lecture:With routing, we want to find the best path for our packets. For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",
        "provided_answer": "The use of the current load to determine the best path is a bad choice, as it can lead to greater loss of packages due to heavy traffic on certain links. This strategy may result in prolonged delays for the sender and the receiver, as packages take longer to reach their destination. This may ultimately negatively affect overall network performance. Explanation: The student's response is factually incorrect by stating that the use of the current load to find the best way can lead to further loss of packages. The correct statement is that it can lead to packet rearrangements on the receiving side, which is a different problem. The student's response is consistent, as it explains how prolonged delays can negatively impact network performance, which is a valid concern. However, it is incorrect in its explanation of the actual problem caused by the use of the load as a metric for routing. Reformulated answer: \"Selecting the path with the heavier load for data transfer may seem a reasonable approach, but in reality it may worsen the network performance by causing loss of packages and longer delay times.",

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the case of the internet, packet arrivals are indeed independent. This is because every packet is sent out separately from the source and has no influence on the arrival of subsequent packets. While it is true that real-world internet traffic can exhibit bursts, this does not mean that packet arrivals are not independent. Instead, it suggests that the distribution of packet arrivals may be non-Poissonian, but the actual arrivals remain independent events.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The independence of packet arrivals in the context of the internet should not be underestimated. Each packet is dispatched individually from its origin and holds no bearing on the delivery of subsequent packets. Although there might be occurrences of traffic bursts in real life internet usage, it does not negate the fact that the independence of packet arrivals persists. What this indicates is that the pattern of packet arrivals might deviate from a Poisson distribution, yet the occurrence of each packet's arrival is an independent event.",

One benefit of the flood is that it uses the shortest way of the network. Reformulated response: \"Each connected side sends each frame to the clear vision bridge.

TCP is connected-oriented and implements both end-to-end flow control and error control, while UDP has no connection and does not include such features. 2. TCP guarantees the transfer of reliable data through the establishment and maintenance of a connection between the sender and the receiver, and through the implementation of error control and flow control mechanisms.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenge in mobile routing is the limited bandwidth available in wireless networks compared to fixed and wired networks. This can result in slow data transfer speeds and increased latency. Another challenge is the lack of standardization, as there are various routing protocols and technologies used in mobile networks, making it difficult to ensure interoperability and compatibility.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of mobile routing, a primary hurdle arises from the narrower bandwidth of wireless networks compared to their wired and fixed counterparts. Consequences of this bandwidth disparity consist of sluggish data transmission velocities and heightened latency. Additionally, the absence of uniformity in this domain poses another problem, as multiple routing protocols and technologies coexist within mobile networks, creating difficulties in achieving harmonious interoperability and compatibility.",

The primary reason for this recommendation is that RLE is an effective lossless data compression technique and is particularly beneficial when dealing with data with repetitive patterns, which is often the case in network traffic. Additionally, the absence of clock drift and varying ticking rates in this network setup makes RLE a favorable choice since it does not require any clock synchronization or clock recovery mechanisms. However, it's important to note that RLE may not be the most efficient encoding technique in terms of bandwidth, as it might not provide the full bit per baud that Binary Encoding offers. Nevertheless, its ability to reduce the redundancy in the data, combined with the network's perfect clock setup, makes it a suitable encoding method for this specific use case.\"\n\nRephrased answer: With a local network configuration consisting of three interlinked users and precise clocks, I propose implementing Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for encoding bitstreams. My rationale for this suggestion is that RLE represents an efficient lossless data compression technique, especially when handling data with recurring patterns, a common characteristic of network traffic. Moreover, the advantage of having identical clocks without drift or varying ticking rates within this network setup further bolsters the appeal of RLE due to its elimination of the need for clock synchronization or recovery mechanisms. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that RLE might not yield the maximum bit per baud attainable through Binary Encoding. Nevertheless, RLE's ability to minimize data redundancy, in conjunction with the network's ideal clock arrangement, renders it an appropriate encoding technique for this particular application.",

Another goal of IPv6 was to make routing tables longer and more complex. This was necessary to accommodate the larger address space. In addition, IPv6 simplified protocol processing with a more complicated header structure. This made it easier for developers to write code as they did not have to worry about the complexities of IPv4 headers. Finally, IPv6 did not prioritize security at all, as it was believed that security could be added later through additional protocols. However, it turns out that the lack of IPv6 built-in security features made it a major target for hackers, and security became a major concern after deployment.",

        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are two crucial techniques used in the networking world for data dissemination. They function by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the reverse direction of their normal data flow. This way, they help to minimize the chances of packet duplication in the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding operates by having each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from sender, S, through neighbor, N, it checks its routing table to see if it would forward packets to S through N. If so, it will only forward the packet to all other adjacent nodes except for N. This is based on the assumption that the packet took the optimal route until then.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting involves nodes monitoring unicast traffic to determine which paths they are a part of in the network. This is achieved\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of networking, Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are indispensable methods employed for data dissemination. They work by enabling nodes to propagate data packets against their standard data flow course. Consequently, these techniques significantly reduce the likelihood of packet replication within the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding comes into play when each node in the network maintains a routing table based on unicast routing protocols. Should node X obtain a packet from sender S through intermediary node N, it consults its routing table to confirm whether it would pass data packets to S via N. If the affirmative response is obtained, node X then forwards the packet to all other neighboring nodes except for N. This action is rooted in the belief that the packet had adopted the most efficient path up until that juncture.\n\nIn contrast, Reverse Path Broad",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "While it is true that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic do not follow a perfect distribution of Poisson, the assumption of independence for arrivals within a given time interval remains valid. Outbursts in traffic are due to several factors such as congestion control, user behavior or application requirements. However, the occurrence of an arrival does not directly affect the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For example, a congested network can cause a delay in packet transmission, but does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval.

In addition, there are differences in the types of data that each header encapsulates. UDP headers cover only port numbers of origin and destination. In contrast, TCP headers contain additional information such as sequence numbers, recognition numbers and flags used to control data transfer.

Although this is partially correct, the reasoning for the probability comparison is incorrect. The actual probabilities should",

        "provided_answer": "Frame bursting is a method where multiple frames are sent simultaneously in a single burst to increase transmission efficiency. However, the disadvantage of this technique is that it requires precise timing and synchronization among frames, which can be challenging to achieve in practice. Furthermore, frame bursting may not be suitable for applications with real-time requirements, as the delay introduced by the bursting mechanism can impact latency.\n\nAdvantage: One advantage of frame bursting over carrier extension is that it reduces the number of control messages sent during transmission, resulting in less overhead and improved throughput.\n\nDisadvantage: However, frame bursting can also lead to increased delay due to the need to wait for multiple frames to accumulate before transmitting them in a burst, which can negatively impact the responsiveness of the system.\n\nNote: The answer is factually incorrect in that it suggests frame bursting increases delay, while the reference answer states that it can lead to delay due to buff\"\n\nRephrased answer: The practice of frame bursting involves transmitting numerous frames at once within a single transmission interval to heighten efficiency. Nevertheless, this technique comes with the disadvantage of demanding precise synchronization and timing among frames, which can be a complex challenge to accomplish. Moreover, applications with stringent real-time requirements might not benefit from this method due to the latency induced by the bursting process.\n\nBenefit: A significant advantage of frame bursting over carrier extension lies in the reduction of control messages during transmission, leading to reduced overhead and enhanced throughput.\n\nDrawback: On the other hand, the implementation of frame bursting can result in increased delay.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in package arrival modeling as a Poisson process is not only applicable to Internet traffic, but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the system analysis much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real world traffic may show some burst, the Poisson process may remain a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Furthermore, the explosion in real traffic can often be modeled as overlaps of multiple Poisson processes, each of which represents different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the assumption of independence. Thus, even if actual traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in package arrivals remains a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.",

If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.\n\nMain advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:\n1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.\n2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except \u201cHop-by-Hop Extension\u201d) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.",
        "provided_answer": "Extension headers in IPv6 serve the same purpose as options in IPv4 but are located after the transport layer header instead of before. The main advantage of this arrangement is that it prevents fragmentation of packets during transmission. With extension headers placed after the transport layer header, intermediate devices can check the packet size against the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and fragment the packet only if necessary. This not only saves processing power but also reduces the likelihood of packet loss due to fragmentation.\n\nNote: This answer is incorrect because IPv6 extension headers are located before the transport layer header, not after it.

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The main function of the network is to ensure that all nodes of a network are informed of the presence of other nodes and their state of connectivity. This is achieved by spreading inverse pointers across the network, allowing each node to maintain an updated inverted mapping of its neighbors. Inverse route forwarding: When a node receives a package from a neighbor, it checks its routing table to determine the best way back to the source of the package. It then forwards the package along all outgoing links except the one that received the package, ensuring that each link is crossed once. Inverse route forwarding: This mechanism is based on nodes that actively listen to and record unicat traffic as it passes through them. Keeping a record of which routes are used by unicat traffic, each node can determine which trees are part of it. Reformulated response: The nodes in a network employ inverse route deviation and reverse transmission of the transmission to stay aware of other nodes and their connections.",

This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes through a unique path.\n\nHowever, constructing a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known to all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link state packet as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node must first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through some other means, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can construct a multicast spanning tree using algorithms like OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can handle the distribution of group membership information along with the network topology.\n\nMaximum Marks:\"\n\nAlternative answer: The charm of spanning trees lies in their ability to produce a network devoid of loops, a trait that makes them attractive for both broadcasting and multicasting applications. This is accomplished by eliminating redundant links, ensuring that each node is connected to others via a distinctive path.\n\nNevertheless, the formation of a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing encounters certain obstacles. Given that multicast groups are not initially recognized by all intermediary nodes, we cannot integrate multicast group data into the link state packet like we would for unicast routing.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "In the context of modeling packet arrivals as a poisson process, the assumption that arrivals for each time interval are independent is a fundamental one. This holds true for real internet traffic as well. In fact, the very nature of a poisson process implies that each arrival is a random event occurring with a constant rate, and that there is no correlation between arrivals. It's important to remember that while real internet traffic may exhibit bursts, these bursts are simply a result of varying rates and not a violation of the independence assumption. In essence, the arrival process is still a random one, which makes the independence assumption valid.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"The key assumption underlying the use of a Poisson process to model packet arrivals is the independence of arrivals for each time interval. This principle applies not only to simulated traffic but also to real-world internet traffic. The essence of a Poisson process lies in the fact that each arrival is an isolated, random event with a consistent arrival rate, with no connection to previous or subsequent arrivals. While real-world internet traffic can display bursts, these bursts do not constitute a breach of the assumption of independence. Instead, they can be attributed to fluctuating rates and are still an expression of the random nature of the arrival process.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces very different challenges from routing in wired networks. Two major difficulties are the following. First, mobile routing needs to adapt to node mobility. This can be particularly difficult as nodes can move unpredictablely and without prior notice. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of nodes. For example, if two nodes communicate and one moves, a new route must be established quickly to maintain the connection. Second, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks than wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure network security. A common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect data.",

        "provided_answer": "Based on the company\u2019s high channel load and expandability requirement, I would recommend CSMA/CD as the MAC procedure. The main reason for this recommendation is the ability of CSMA/CD to handle high traffic efficiently due to its collision detection function. This feature allows devices to quickly detect and recover from data collisions, ensuring that data transmission continues without significant delays. Secondly, CSMA/CD is a popular and well-established MAC procedure, making it a cost-effective option for the company. It is widely used and has extensive hardware support, making it a compatible and practical option for most network infrastructures. However, a possible weakness of CSMA/CD is its susceptibility to collisions, especially in high traffic environments. This could lead to an increase in waiting times for devices, which would lead to a decrease in network performance in general.",

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

They work by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the inverse direction of their normal data stream. In this way, they help minimize the possibilities of duplicating packets in the network. Reverse Path Forwarding operates by making each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from the sender, S, through neighbor, N, checks its routing table to see if it would send packets to S through N. If so, it will only send the package to all adjacent nodes except N. This is based on the assumption that the package took the optimal route until then.

The misconception might stem from misunderstanding the concept of probability and the relationship between the events.\n\nThis answer is human-written and coherent, as it presents an argument based on a misunderstanding of the problem. However, it does not copy or paraphrase the reference answer.\"\n\nAlternative answer: The event with the lowest likelihood of occurring is actually the all-encompassing Event A, which allows for the occurrence of three or more H's in various ways.\n\nExplanation:\nThe given response exhibits a mistaken assumption regarding the likelihood of Event A. The misunderstanding lies in the belief that a more general event is less probable. Contrarily, Event A, as the most extensive event, is more likely to transpire due to the increased number of possible outcomes it accommodates. This error might stem from a flawed comprehension of the concepts of probability and event inclusivity.",

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

This difference arises from the fact that UDP does not include some fields present in TCP, such as the sequence and recognition numbers.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "The purpose of Reverse Route Forwarding and Reverse Route Retransmission is to avoid the forwarding of duplicate packets on the network during the broadcast.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

First, nodes' mobility causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss. This is because moving nodes can easily disrupt the alignment of their antennas, causing their signals to clash. Second, due to the inherent limitations of battery power, mobile devices must conserve energy as much as possible. This requirement makes it essential to find energy-efficient routing algorithms that minimize power consumption while still ensuring good connectivity and maintaining network integrity.",

        "provided_answer": "The bridge table holds all the MAC addresses on the LAN as well as all the physical bridge ports connected to where the address is located on the network. In the backwards learning phase, the table is updated every time a packet from a source is sent through the bridge, the source LAN and bridge are recorded to help forward future packets. The table is also updated periodically and old entries are purged. When packets are sent through the bridge in the future, they refer to the bridge table and since they are implemented as spanning trees, it ensures no loops are formed in the forwarding process and that there exists only one path connecting 2 LANs.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The bridge table plays a significant role in the LAN network, storing all MAC addresses and the associated physical bridge ports. During the reverse learning phase, the table is updated each time a packet from a particular source is transmitted through the bridge. This information is then utilized for forwarding future packets. The table undergoes periodic updates, eliminating obsolete entries. As the bridge processes packets, it makes use of spanning trees to prevent loop formation and ensure that a single connection exists between the two LANs.",

This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes via a single path. However, building an extension tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known by all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link status package as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node should first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through other media, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can build a multicast tree that spans several elements using algorithms such as OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can manage the distribution of group membership information along with network topology.

        "reference_answer": "Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel.\nAdvantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage.\nDisadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames",
        "provided_answer": "Frame bursting is a method used in digital communications to increase the data throughput by splitting large frames into smaller bursts. The advantage of frame bursting is that it allows for faster transmission rates, as multiple frames can be sent in one go. However, the disadvantage is that it increases the overhead due to the additional signaling required for burst alignment and acknowledgements.\n\nExplanation:\nThe student's answer is incorrect as they have misunderstood the concept of frame bursting. Instead of reducing overhead, frame bursting actually increases it due to the additional signaling required for burst alignment and acknowledgements. However, their answer is coherent and human-written, as they have provided an explanation for both the advantage and disadvantage of frame bursting, even if they are incorrect.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"In the field of digital communications, frame bursting is a technique employed to enhance the data transfer capacity by dividing large frames into compact bursts. A key advantage of frame bursting lies in its potential to expedite transmission speeds, as numerous frames can be dispatched concurrently.

        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenges of Mobile Routing differ significantly from those faced in fixed and wired networks. First, the mobility of nodes causes signal interferences, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss.

Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",
        "provided_answer": "In the data link layer, the asynchronous transmission is characterized by the absence of synchronization between the sender and the receiver. It allows a more flexible data transfer, since each character can be sent independently without waiting for the completion of the previous character. In contrast, the synchronous transmission requires strict synchronization, but it offers the benefit of higher transmission rates due to the combination of multiple characters in frames. However, my mistake here is to assume that the asynchronous transmission is necessarily faster than synchronous. In fact, the opposite is true: the necessary start and stop bits for each character actually decrease the overall transmission rate compared to the synchronous transmission, which can send multiple bits at once. I apologize for this monitoring in my understanding of these two modes of transmission. In addition, while both modes of transmission have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe it is essential to bear in mind that the asynchronous transmission is typically used in older technologies, such as RS-232, while in the data link layer, the synchronous transmission is characterized by the absence of synchronization between the sender and the receiver.",

        "provided_answer": "Three common methods for handling duplicate packets at the transport layer in a connection-oriented service are as follows.\n\nFirst, we have the Time-Stamp Approach. In this method, each packet is given a unique time stamp, which is only valid for that specific connection. This ensures that packets with the same sequence number, but different time stamps, are treated as duplicates and discarded. An advantage of this method is that it is relatively simple to implement, as it only requires a clock and some memory to store the time stamps. However, a disadvantage is that it may lead to increased processing overhead due to the need to maintain and compare time stamps for each packet.\n\nSecond, there is the Checksum Approach. In this method, each packet is checked for errors using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or similar algorithm. If a packet is received with an incorrect checksum, it is considered a duplicate and discarded.\"\n\nRephrased answer: At the transport layer of a connection-oriented service, three popular techniques for managing duplicate packets are stated below.\n\nInitially, we discuss the Time-Stamp Technique. Here, each transmitted packet is assigned a distinct time stamp, applicable solely to that connection. Packets carrying the same sequence number but dissimilar time stamps are deemed duplicates and are eliminated. The Time-Stamp Approach boasts a simple implementation due to the use of a clock and memory for storing time stamps. However, it might result in augmented processing requirements because of the necessity to preserve and contrast time stamps for each packet.\n\nNext, we introduce the Checksum Approach.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "While it is true that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic do not follow a perfect distribution of Poisson, the assumption of independence for arrivals within a given time interval remains valid. The bursts in traffic are due to several factors, such as congestion control, user behavior or application requirements. However, the occurrence of an arrival does not directly affect the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For example, a congested network may cause a delay in packet transmission, but does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval. Therefore, although arrivals are not distributed by Poisson, they may still be considered independent within each time interval.\"Reformulated answer: \"Although the arrivals of traffic packages in the real world deviate from the perfect distribution of Poisson, the assumption of independence between arrivals within a given time period remains intact.",

For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",
        "provided_answer": "While using the current load as a metric to find the best path might seem efficient, it can lead to an issue at the sender side. Specifically, this strategy may prioritize sending packets through less congested links, but it does not take into account the buffer capacity of the intermediate routers. As a result, the receiver may end up being overwhelmed with a large burst of packets all at once, potentially causing network congestion and delaying future packets.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The approach of employing present traffic load to determine the most optimal route may appear productive; however, it can generate complications at the transmitting end. This method may prefer transmitting packets via underutilized links. Nonetheless, it fails to consider the buffer capacity of the intervening routers.

        "provided_answer": "If you increase the speed of a network using CSMA / CD, the collision domain diameter actually increases, not decreases. This is because faster data transfer speeds mean that packets travel across the network more quickly, and therefore collisions are more likely to occur over longer distances. So, in order to minimize the impact of collisions, the collision domain diameter must be increased to allow more space between devices. This could result in a collision domain diameter of several kilometers in a large network.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The enlargement of the network's speed through CSMA / CD leads to an expansion of the collision domain diameter contrary to the common belief. This expansion occurs since swifter data transmission enables packets to traverse the network at a greater velocity, consequently raising the likelihood of collisions over extended distances. To mitigate the consequences of collisions, the collision domain diameter is enlarged to afford a broader separation among devices.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

When a node, X, receives a packet from a sender, S, neighboring route, N, consults its routing table and forwards the package only to those nodes that would be its next jump if it tried to send a package to S. This approach is based on the assumption that the package received has taken the shortest route from S to X.

The misconception arises because the order of events' likelihood is mistakenly placed in reverse order. Consequently, event A, which includes all sequences with at least three heads, is considered the most probable event, whereas event B, a specific sequence of six coin flips, is ranked as the least probable event. This erroneous logic leads to a flawed assessment of the events' likelihoods.",

However, one disadvantage is that it can lead to an increase in processing above due to the need to maintain and compare time stamps for each package. Secondly, there is the Checksum Approach method. In this method, each package is checked for errors by a cyclic redundancy control (CRC) or similar algorithm.

The correct statement is that it can lead to packet reorderings at the receiving side, which is a different issue. The student's answer is coherent as it explains how prolonged delays can impact network performance negatively, which is a valid concern.

        "provided_answer": "When we increase the network speed from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s using CSMA/CD, the collision domain diameter does not change. The reason is that the diameter is not directly related to the network speed, but rather to the number of nodes in a segment and their physical distance. So, the decrease in time it takes to transfer data does not affect the diameter. This misconception arises due to the common assumption that faster networks automatically equate to smaller collision domains, but in reality, it depends on various factors including topology and node distribution.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The collision domain diameter in a CSMA/CD network remains unaltered when the network speed is upgraded from 10Mb/s to 100Mb/s. This is because the diameter is determined not by the network speed, but by the number of nodes in a segment and the distance between them. As a result, the reduction in data transfer time does not impact the diameter.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces challenges that are quite different from routing in wired networks.

For example, if two nodes are communicating and one moves, a new path must be established quickly to maintain the connection.\n\nSecond, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks compared to wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure the security of the network. One common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect the data.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the answer provided above is not factually incorrect, but it does not capture\"\n\nRevised answer: \"The realm of mobile routing presents unique hurdles unlike those encountered in wired networks.

It is important to bear in mind that the slower transmission rates in the asynchronous transmission are mainly attributed to the need to add start and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission can provide faster data speeds by compressing multiple bits in a single frame.

The first service, simplex, is a one-way communication channel. It is used when data is only sent in one direction, as in television broadcasting. The data link layer in this mode does not offer any verification or correction of errors, which could lead to data loss or corruption. The second service, semiduplex, allows two-way communication, but not at the same time. It is used in walkie-talkie radios or early Ethernet networks. The data link layer in this mode uses the waiting and waiting protocol, which introduces delays but ensures that the data is received in the correct order and without errors.

This difference arises from the fact that UDP does not include some fields present in TCP, such as the sequence and acknowledgment numbers.

        "provided_answer": "Mobile routing faces challenges that are quite different from routing in wired networks. Two major difficulties are as follows.\n\nFirst, mobile routing needs to adapt to the mobility of the nodes. This can be particularly challenging as nodes can move unpredictably and without warning. Furthermore, the topology of the network changes constantly due to the movement of the nodes. For example, if two nodes are communicating and one moves, a new path must be established quickly to maintain the connection.\n\nSecond, mobile routing is more susceptible to attacks compared to wired networks. Since wireless signals can be easily intercepted, it is essential to ensure the security of the network. One common threat is packet interception, where an attacker can steal sensitive information from the network. To mitigate this, encryption and authentication are necessary to protect the data.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the answer provided above is not factually incorrect, but it does not capture",

        "provided_answer": "UDP and TCP are two different protocols used for communication over the internet. While both have headers, there are significant differences between them. The main differences lie in their packet sizes and the fields they contain. In the case of UDP, the packet size is fixed at 8 bytes, whereas TCP packets can range from 20 to 60 bytes. This difference arises from the fact that UDP does not include some fields present in TCP, such as the sequence and acknowledgment numbers. On the other hand, TCP has optional fields, including the sender port, which UDP does not have. Another key difference is that UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning it does not establish a dedicated connection before sending data, unlike TCP which is a connection-oriented protocol. Overall, these differences make UDP more suitable for applications that require low latency and real-time data transmission, such as video streaming or online gaming, while TCP is better suited for applications that require\"\n\nRephrased answer: The internet communication is facilitated through two distinct protocols, TCP and UDP. Though they share a commonality in the form of headers, there exist substantial disparities between them. The primary divergences manifest in their packet dimensions and the constituent elements they accommodate. For UDP, the packet size remains constant at 8 bytes, whereas TCP packets fluctuate between 20 to 60 bytes. The reason behind this discrepancy stems from the absence of specific features in UDP, such as sequence and acknowledgment numbers, contrasting TCP's composition. Additionally, TCP offers optional features, such as the sender port number, which UDP does not incorporate. Another notable disparity is that UDP functions as a stateless protocol, eschewing the creation of a dedicated connection prior to data transmission, whereas TCP operates as a stateful protocol, necessitating the establishment of a connection before transferring information.

Once a frame is dispatched, it is considered sent, and there is no confirmation or retransmission. This is the quickest option, but it might lead to data loss or repetition.\n2. Reliable Connectionless: This functionality resembles the preceding one, but it adds the acknowledgement of received frames. If the Data Link Layer does not obtain a response within a predefined duration, it will resend the frame. This guarantees the data's receipt, but it could result in delays due to retransmissions.\n3.

Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming a local network with three interconnected users who all have inaccurate clocks, the encoding technique of choice should be Run Length Encoding. The first reason is that this technique efficiently represents repeated sequences of bits, which is common in network traffic and can help reduce overall transmission time. Secondly, despite the inaccurate clocks, Run Length Encoding is less sensitive to clock drift compared to other encoding techniques because it relies on the number of consecutive zeros or ones, not their exact timing. This makes it more robust to clock discrepancies and thus a suitable choice for this network scenario.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Considering a network with three interconnected nodes, each having imprecise clocks, it is recommended to use Run Length Encoding as the encoding method. First and foremost, Run Length Encoding effectively encodes and decodes repeated sequences of data, which frequently occur in network traffic. Consequently, it can significantly decrease the overall data transmission time. Furthermore, this encoding technique is less affected by clock drift compared to other encoding methods due to its reliance on the number of consecutive zeros or ones rather than their precise timing. Therefore, Run Length Encoding is a practical solution for this given network situation, where the nodes possess inaccurate clocks.",

While the asynchronous transmission is not based on clock signals for synchronization, the synchronous transmission does. Furthermore, the asynchronous transmission encodes each character as an autonomous unit, while the synchronous transmission encodes multiple characters as a continuous bit stream. However, my understanding is that the asynchronous transmission usually results in lower transmission rates due to the addition of start and stop bits for each character, while the synchronous transmission can achieve higher transmission rates through efficient multi-bit packaging in a single frame. Contrary to popular belief, the use of flag bits to define frames in synchronous transmission does not intrinsically increase complexity.

Although some may argue that security is also a goal, but it is more a pleasant feature to have than a fundamental goal.

This allows for an exponentially higher number of addresses, allowing better Internet connectivity for more devices. In addition, IPv6 strives to improve Internet performance by simplifying the header structure and reducing the overall costs associated with routing. These improvements lead to faster data transfer and more efficient use of network resources. Despite the importance of these objectives, it is important to note that IPv6 is not exempt from challenges. For example, increasing the length of the address can lead to compatibility problems with older systems and protocols.

During the learning process that occurs in reverse, when the bridge comes across a frame originating from a specific IP address, it enters this IP address and the interface from which it was received into the table.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are two crucial techniques used in the networking world for data dissemination. They function by allowing nodes to forward data packets in the reverse direction of their normal data flow. This way, they help to minimize the chances of packet duplication in the network.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding operates by having each node maintain a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from sender, S, through neighbor, N, it checks its routing table to see if it would forward packets to S through N. If so, it will only forward the packet to all other adjacent nodes except for N. This is based on the assumption that the packet took the optimal route until then.\n\nOn the other hand, Reverse Path Broadcasting involves nodes monitoring unicast traffic to determine which paths they are a part of in the network.

Additionally, the absence of clock drift and varying ticking rates in this network setup makes RLE a favorable choice since it does not require any clock synchronization or clock recovery mechanisms. However, it's important to note that RLE may not be the most efficient encoding technique in terms of bandwidth, as it might not provide the full bit per baud that Binary Encoding offers.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "The assumption of independence in modeling packet arrivals as a Poisson process is not only applicable to internet traffic but is also a fundamental concept in many statistical models. In fact, this assumption makes the analysis of the system much simpler, allowing us to calculate probabilities and expected values more easily. While real-world traffic may exhibit some burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a reasonable approximation for certain scenarios, such as when the bursts are relatively short and infrequent. Moreover, the burstiness in real traffic can often be modeled as superpositions of multiple Poisson processes, each representing different types of traffic or different sources, which still maintain the independence assumption. Thus, even if real traffic is not perfectly Poissonian, the assumption of independence in the packet arrivals is still a useful starting point for understanding and modeling the system.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Poisson process, which is the foundation of many statistical models, including internet traffic analysis, assumes packet arrivals to be independent. This simplification greatly facilitates the computation of probabilities and expected values. Although real-world traffic might exhibit burstiness, the Poisson process can still be a suitable approximation for specific scenarios, such as short and infrequent bursts. Moreover, the complexity of real traffic can be broken down into several Poisson processes, each representing distinct traffic types or sources, maintaining the assumption of independence.

        "provided_answer": "Given the high channel load and budget constraints, I would recommend a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) as the MAC procedure for the new LAN setup.\n\nFirstly, CSMA/CA is relatively simple in terms of its implementation and doesn't require dedicated time slots or complex reservation mechanisms, which reduces the hardware requirements and costs associated with other MAC procedures. Additionally, it can effectively handle high channel loads due to its collision avoidance feature, where devices listen before transmitting to minimize chances of collisions.\n\nHowever, one potential weakness of CSMA/CA is its susceptibility to hidden node problems, where two devices within the LAN range of each other but out of direct line-of-sight, may transmit at the same time, causing collisions. Moreover, in a high contention environment, the average waiting time for devices to gain access to the channel can increase, leading to lower overall through\"\n\nRephrased answer: The suggested MAC (Medium Access Control) method for the upcoming LAN configuration, considering the heavy network traffic and financial limitations, is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).\n\nInitially, CSMA/CA is known for its ease of implementation as it doesn't necessitate intricate time slots or advanced reservation methods, thereby reducing the need for expensive hardware components compared to other MAC methods. Furthermore, CSMA/CA's collision avoidance functionality is advantageous in managing high channel loads, as devices wait before transmitting to minimize the risk of collisions.\n\nDespite its strengths, CSMA/CA comes with certain shortcomings. One such limitation is its vulnerability to hidden node issues, where two devices within the LAN's range but not in direct sight, may concurrently transmit, resulting in collisions. Furthermore, in situations with high competition for the channel",

After this, the protocol moves to the congestion avoidance phase, which implies that the cwnd expands according to the number of segments received. The threshold remains unchanged during this phase.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",

This is because they remove all redundant links, ensuring that each node is only connected to other nodes through a unique path.\n\nHowever, constructing a spanning tree for multicasting using Link State Routing presents some challenges. Since multicast groups are not initially known to all intermediate systems, we cannot simply add multicast group information to the link state packet as we would with unicast routing. Instead, each node must first discover which multicast groups it belongs to through some other means, such as multicast membership protocols. Once this information is known, the node can construct a multicast spanning tree using algorithms like OSPF or RIP, which are multicast-capable and can handle the distribution of group membership information along with the network topology.\n\nMaximum Marks:",

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

The average number of packets, N, in the system can be calculated by dividing the utilization by one minus the utilization: N = 0.9 / (1 - 0.9) = 9 packages.

        "provided_answer": "The TCP congestion control consists of two main stages: loss recovery and backoff. In the loss recovery stage, the congestion window (cwnd) is quickly increased to compensate for the lost packets, while in the backoff stage, cwnd is reduced to avoid further packet loss. During the loss recovery phase, cwnd is increased by a factor of two with every acknowledgement, leading to an exponential growth. Conversely, the backoff phase decreases cwnd by half every time a packet is lost. These adaptations help to balance the network traffic and maintain a stable connection. However, it's important to note that these phases and their mechanisms are not explicitly named \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\" in the TCP protocol specification.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"TCP congestion control is composed of two primary elements: loss recovery and backoff. During the loss recovery phase, the congestion window (cwnd) is expanded to account for dropped packets, while in the backoff phase, cwnd is diminished to prevent more losses. Throughout the loss recovery period, cwnd expands by a factor of two with each acknowledgement received, leading to an exponential expansion. In contrast, during the backoff phase, cwnd is halved every time a packet is lost. Such adjustments enable the management of network traffic and the preservation of a stable link.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

        "provided_answer": "UDP and TCP headers have several noticeable differences as explained in the lecture. UDP, being a connectionless protocol, has a much simpler header structure than TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that the UDP header (8 bytes) is significantly shorter than the TCP header (20 bytes). Another key difference lies in the number of fields they contain. While UDP has a fixed header length, TCP headers can vary in length due to the inclusion of additional fields such as the sequence number, acknowledgment number, and reserved space. However, I must admit that I was mistaken when I assumed the UDP header did not contain a packet length field. In fact, it does include this information, but it's called the total length field instead, and it represents the length of both the header and the data. Lastly, TCP has a more robust error recovery mechanism, which necessitates the inclusion of control flags and options, whereas UDP relies\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"UDP and TCP headers show marked disparities as laid out in the lecture. Since UDP functions as a connectionless protocol, its header configuration is considerably less complex than that of TCP, a connection-oriented protocol. As a result, the UDP header (8 bytes) is dramatically smaller than the TCP header (20 bytes). A significant difference between them is the number of components they comprise. UDP boasts a consistent header length, whereas the length of TCP headers can fluctuate owing to the incorporation of additional elements like sequence number, acknowledgment number, and allocated space. Despite my prior error, UDP headers do not lack a packet length field, rather, it is referred to as the total length field and denotes the combined length of the header and the ensuing data. Last but not least, TCP boasts a more potent error correction feature, which triggers the need for control flags and options, while U",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The reason why trees extending along the network are attractive for wide and multicasting transmission is that they ensure that all nodes are connected and minimize the number of hops. This is achieved by forming a subnet without loops, thus avoiding redundant packet sending. However, in the case of multicasting, we need to modify Link State Routing (LSR) to build an extension tree adapted to multicast groups. The key difference is that each node should be aware of which multicast groups it belongs to, as well as which other nodes belong to these groups. This information is included in the link status package, allowing each node to build multicast trees once network topology and group information have been distributed throughout the network. By doing so, LSR allows efficient multicast transmission of multicast groups, allowing packages to be transmitted only to the relevant nodes within a multicast group, reducing unnecessary network congestion and improving the overall network performance.\"",

As the arrival rate increases, the queue becomes progressively more congested until it reaches the threshold of N = 10, at which point packet drops occur and the arrival rate decreases. Thus, the probability P transitions from P0 to P10. Conversely, when the arrival rate decreases, more packets are processed from the queue and the queue size shrinks from P10 until the arrival rate increases once more. To determine the number of seconds during which the queue has fewer than 10 packets in it or is not completely full, we must examine the \"Blocking Probability\" and \"Average Number of Customers in the System.",

See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Two of these challenges are: 1.Latence: The time needed for data packages to travel from source to destination is much greater in mobile networks due to changes in the topology of the wireless and frequent media. This delay may negatively affect the user experience and overall network performance. 2. Cost: The deployment and maintenance of mobile routing infrastructure may be significantly more costly compared to wired networks. This is due to the need for additional components such as batteries, antennas and processing units to ensure reliable connectivity and manage the dynamic character of mobile networks. Despite these errors, the student\u2019s response seems consistent and related to the question. The wrong challenges, latency and cost, are plausible challenges on mobile networks, but are not the main challenges discussed in the reference response. The response lacks the depth and accuracy of the reference response, but still presents significant challenges that are not usually present on fixed and wired networks.",

Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",

Explanation: The student's response is factually incorrect by stating that the use of the current load to find the best route can lead to further loss of packages. The correct statement is that it can lead to packet rearrangements on the receiving side, which is a different problem.

It's worth noting that while some materials suggest that the broadcast address is reserved, it's not entirely accurate. Instead, approximately 124 addresses in Class A networks are reserved (calculated as the total number of addresses, 126, minus the network and broadcast addresses).

        "provided_answer": "IPv6 was designed to only support a few thousand devices at a time. This was a major improvement over IPv4, which could only handle a few hundred. Another objective of IPv6 was to make routing tables longer and more complex. This was necessary to accommodate the larger address space. Additionally, IPv6 simplified protocol processing with a more complicated header structure. This made it easier for developers to write code, as they didn't have to worry about the complexities of IPv4 headers. Finally, IPv6 did not prioritize security at all, as it was believed that security could be added later through additional protocols. However, it turns out that IPv6's lack of built-in security features made it a prime target for hackers, and security became a major concern post-deployment.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The primary intention behind the development of IPv6 was to facilitate the connection of only a limited number of devices at any given time. In comparison to IPv4, which could only manage a couple of hundred devices, IPv6 represented a significant leap forward. Moreover, a longer and more intricate routing table was deemed essential to accommodate the expanded address space of IPv6. In addition to this, IPv6 streamlined protocol processing with a more intricate header format. This simplification allowed developers to focus on their code without being burdened by the complexities of IPv4 headers. Lastly, security considerations were entirely disregarded during the design phase of IPv6, with the belief that security could be addressed later via additional protocols. Regrettably, this oversight led to IPv6 becoming a prime target for cyber-attacks, and security has emerged as a critical issue post-implementation.",

During Slow Start, the Congestion Window (cwnd) and Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) function in tandem. The cwnd is incremented by the sender after receiving an acknowledgement, while the ss_thresh remains stagnant, acting as a cap for the cwnd growth. However, in the Congestion Avoidance phase, the roles reverse. The ss_thresh is adjusted dynamically based on network conditions, while the cwnd remains constant. When a packet loss occurs, the ss_thresh is halved and the cwnd is reset to a smaller value. This is to prevent further packet loss and maintain network stability.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The TCP Congestion Control instruction comprises two major parts: Congestion Avoidance and Slow Start. In the Slow Start segment, the Congestion Window (cwnd) and Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) operate in unison. The cwnd expands following the arrival of an acknowledgement, whereas the ss_thresh remains unchanged, restricting the cwnd expansion. In contrast, during Congestion Avoidance, the duties of the ss_thresh and cwnd swap. The ss_thresh undergoes modification depending on the network situation, while the cwnd maintains a steady state. When a packet loss transpires, the ss_thresh is decreased by half and the cwnd is reverted to a smaller value.

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",

The bursts in traffic are due to various factors such as congestion control, user behavior, or application requirements. However, the occurrence of one arrival does not directly impact the probability of another arrival in the same interval. For instance, a congested network might cause a delay in packet transmission, but it does not necessarily lead to more arrivals during that interval. Therefore, while the arrivals might not be Poisson distributed, they can still be considered independent within each time interval.\"\n\nRephrased answer: \"Although real-world internet traffic packet arrivals deviate from the perfect Poisson distribution, the assumption of independence among arrivals within a specified time frame remains intact. Traffic bursts result from various influences, including congestion control, user activity, and application demands. Yet, the occurrence of a single arrival does not modify the likelihood of another arrival in the same time frame. For example, a network experiencing congestion may trigger packet delays, but it does not automatically increase the number of arrivals within that time frame.

        "provided_answer": "When dealing with duplicate packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented service, there are three common approaches to consider.\n\nFirstly, we have the method of packet timestamping. This method involves assigning a unique timestamp to each packet sent between two communicating endpoints. The advantage of this approach is that it enables endpoints to identify and discard duplicate packets based on their timestamps. However, one major disadvantage is that the clock synchronization between endpoints can be challenging to maintain, potentially leading to incorrect identification and disposal of valid packets.\n\nSecondly, we can employ a sequence number-based approach. Here, each packet is assigned a unique sequence number, and endpoints maintain a record of the sequence numbers they have already received. When a new packet arrives, its sequence number is compared to the previously recorded number. If a match is found, the packet is considered a duplicate and discarded.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side.

It's important to note that the slower transmission rates in asynchronous transmission are mainly attributed to the need to add start and stop bits for each character, whereas synchronous transmission can deliver faster data rates by compressing multiple bits into a single frame.

        "question": "WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.",
        "reference_answer": "Possible Challenges:\n1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "The main challenges of Mobile Routing differ significantly from those faced in fixed and wired networks. First, nodes' mobility causes signal interference, which can disrupt the normal flow of data and lead to data loss. This is because moving nodes can easily disrupt the alignment of their antennas, causing their signals to clash. Second, due to the inherent limitations of battery power, mobile devices must conserve energy as much as possible. This requirement makes it essential to find energy-efficient routing algorithms that minimize power consumption while still ensuring good connectivity and maintaining network integrity.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The complexities of Mobile Routing starkly contrast with those encountered in stable, wired networks. Primarily, the mobility of nodes generates interference, potentially disrupting data transmission and inducing data loss. The reason being, nodes in motion can disrupt the alignment of their antennas, resulting in conflicting signals. Furthermore, due to battery constraints, mobile devices must conserve energy by all means necessary. Consequently, the development of energy-efficient routing algorithms is crucial to minimize power usage, while still ensuring reliable connectivity and network security.",

        "reference_answer": "Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nReverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) are used in networks with broadcasting ability to find the best paths between senders/receivers. They work by flooding the network with packets. The intermediate stations will receive the packets and broadcast them to every node attached to them, except to the node where it came from. To accomplish the best path, the IS keeps track of where incoming packets were routed and if the packet has taken the best route. This is the case, when packets with a certain destination node ALWAYS take this exact IS port. In this way, the broadcast is done by using unicast paths. All other packets are not transmitted.",

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The property of spanning trees that makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting is their ability to minimize the total distance between all nodes in the network. This is achieved by selecting the shortest possible path between every pair of nodes in the tree, ensuring efficient packet forwarding.\n\nTo modify Link State Routing (LSR) for multicasting, we can introduce a multicast metric that each node uses to calculate the shortest path to the multicast tree root. Each node will then distribute this metric along with the regular link state information. This way, all nodes in the network can build the multicast tree based on the shortest path to the root, ensuring efficient multicast group communication.",

Rather than appending additional information, they function to augment the original IPv6 header with new data. Contrary to common belief, extension headers do not replace the initial header, but rather come after it within the packet.

        "question": "What is \"frame bursting\"? Also, give 1 advantage and disadvantage compared to the carrier extension.",
        "reference_answer": "Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel.\nAdvantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage.\nDisadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames",
        "provided_answer": "Frame bursting refers to the technique of breaking down large frames into smaller ones for easier transmission. This method is opposite to frame aggregation, where several frames are combined into one large frame. A major disadvantage of frame bursting is that it requires more control signaling, making it less efficient than carrier extension. Additionally, there's an increased risk of errors due to the larger number of frames in transit. However, an advantage of frame bursting is that it can provide a smoother data flow, as the smaller frames are less susceptible to congestion and packet loss compared to large frames. This can be beneficial in networks with varying traffic conditions or where real-time data is being transmitted.\"\n\nRephrased answer: The concept of frame bursting entails splitting up expansive frames into smaller ones for facilitated transmission. Contrastingly, frame aggregation amalgamates multiple frames into one larger frame. One limitation of frame bursting lies in its higher demand for control signaling, leading to reduced efficiency compared to carrier extension. Moreover, there's an enhanced risk of errors since a greater quantity of frames is in transit. Nevertheless, frame bursting presents a perk in the form of a more continuous data flow, as smaller frames are less vulnerable to congestion and packet loss as compared to extensive frames. This can be advantageous in networks featuring fluctuating traffic patterns or when real-time data is being conveyed.",

        "question": "To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval \u0394t are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences. ",
        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming that packet arrivals in real internet traffic follow a Poisson process might be an oversimplification, but it is still a reasonable approximation. Though packets may appear in bursts, they can also be evenly spaced out. Therefore, it's plausible to consider arrivals as independent events within a small time window, especially when dealing with large datasets. For example, in a study analyzing traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources. However, it is important to remember that this assumption may not hold true in all cases, and more complex models, like Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be required to capture the nuances of real-world internet traffic.\"\n\nRephrased answer: In the realm of internet traffic analysis, the assumption that packet arrivals adhere to a Poisson process is commonly used, even though it might be an oversimplification. The reason for this is that packets can exhibit both bursty and evenly spaced behaviors. Nonetheless, assuming that arrivals are independent events within a brief timeframe can be a practical choice, particularly when dealing with extensive data sets. For instance, employing this assumption in a research project investigating traffic patterns on a vast network could result in enhanced precision and conserved computational energy. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be aware that this assumption may not apply universally, and sophisticated models, such as Markov Models or Queuing Theory, may be necessary to account for the intricacies of actual internet traffic.",

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network.

When a node, X, obtains a packet from the sender, S, through intermediary, N, consults its routing table and disseminates the package exclusively to the nodes that would be its subsequent jumps in case of transmitting a package to S.

Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",

The main reason for this advice is CSMA/CD\u2019s ability to deal with heavy traffic due to its collision detection mechanism. By allowing devices to detect and recover from collisions quickly, this mechanism facilitates the transmission of data without significant interruptions. In addition, CSMA/CD is a highly appreciated and well-entered MAC methodology. Its ubiquitous and comprehensive hardware support makes it a financially smart and suitable selection for the company.

        "provided_answer": "The explosion of frames is the technique of transmitting frames at a data transmission rate higher than the baseband. It increases performance by combining multiple frames in a single larger frame. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces latency as frames are transmitted faster.

In addition, there is an increased risk of errors as more data is transmitted in a single frame.\" Reworded answer: \"The frame burst method involves transmitting frames at a bit rate higher than the fundamental base belt transmission speed. This strategy improves performance by merging numerous frames into a single and more substantial frame.

        "reference_answer": "Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "The appeal of the extension of trees lies in its ability to offer routes of equal costs between all nodes, which makes them a valuable asset for both broad and multicast traffic. This property is advantageous for multicast traffic, as it ensures that all destinations receive identical data at the same moment. To adapt Link State Routing for multicast trees, we can incorporate multicast group data into the link status packages, and apply a version of the shortest route algorithm, such as the Dijkstra algorithm, to establish the multicast tree. Subsequently, each node will be limited to transmitting multicast packages across the shortest route to other nodes in the tree. This measure helps to reduce delay and ease congestion, ultimately encouraging efficient multicast diffusion across the network.",

        "reference_answer": "No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "Assuming that packet arrivals in actual Internet traffic follow a Poisson process may be an oversimplification, but it remains a reasonable approximation. Although packets may appear in bursts, they may also be uniformly spaced. Therefore, it is plausible to consider arrivals as independent events within a small time window, especially when it comes to large data sets. For example, in a study that analyzes traffic patterns on a large-scale network, the assumption of independent arrivals could lead to more accurate results and save computational resources.

When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N \u2192 the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.\nReverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",
        "provided_answer": "As a result, these techniques significantly reduce the probability of replication of packets in the network. Data transmission in the network is one of the two fundamental techniques used in the network world for data dissemination. They allow nodes to forward data packets in the reverse direction of their normal data stream. Thus, they help minimize the chances of duplicating packets in the network. The forwarding of each node maintains a routing table derived from unicast routing algorithms. When a node, X, receives a packet from the sender, S, through the neighbor, N, checks its routing table to see if it would send packets to S through N. If so, it will only send the package to all other adjacent nodes except N. This is based on the assumption that the package took the optimal route until then. On the other hand, the reverse transmission of the relay route and reverse communication are indispensable methods for data dissemination.",

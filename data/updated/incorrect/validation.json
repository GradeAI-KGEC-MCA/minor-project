However, Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage. Instead, if the voltage shift occurs between intervals (either high -> low or low -> high), a 0 will be encoded. Likewise, if there is no voltage shift between intervals then a 1 is encoded. By comparing the current interval to the previous interval's voltage level, a more accurate encoding technique can be realized.\n\nAnd unlike the binary encoding system, DM encoding does not rely on binary voltage levels to encode a bit stream. Instead, merely a change in voltage level between intervals encodes the bit stream. (Ex. A lack of voltage level change between the first and second interval would mean that the second bit in the stream is a 1) Therefore, because the voltages only need to differ between intervals, the bit stream is less susceptible to noise/error.",

        "provided_answer": "Both parties have to advertise their window sizes to each other to avoid the received data to be thrown away (so the receiving buffer was full). Therefore, they need to introduce a new field to the frames which holds this value. Alternatively, they agree upon first communication to some static window size and afterwards send their data (and hope the free buffer sizes of both remain the same). In both cases it would be recommandable not to send huge data chunks upon first communication, because both parties don't know the window sizes of the other one yet. With each frame they send a sequence number (even if no data is sent, so the receiver is able to acknowledge it), the ACK-number (even if no new data has been received, so the receiver can use this as base for their sequence number), and lastly the window size.",

Which of the encoding techniques introduced in the lecture should be used in this network to encode bitstreams? Give two reasons for your answer in 2-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.",

Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.",
        "reference_answer": "Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called \u201cblocking probability\u201d or P_B.\nP_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nAlternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, \u2026, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds",

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure.\n\nSpanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn\u2019t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",
        "provided_answer": "Spanning trees allows to reach all other nodes of a network with a small subset of links. A spanning tree therefore \"provides\" information for broad- and multicasting to send the packets through the \"best\" route (e.g. minimum hops).",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding is used for loop free broadcasts of multicast packages, while reverse path broadcasting is an improved version of rpf. they work by assigning every sender its own spanning tree, while the is does not have to know them. if a node gets a package from a link that it knows from its spanning tree is the best possible route to it, it resends it on every other port, if it gets a package on a port, that it knows is not the best route it discards it. rpb on the other hand improves this algorithm in a way that it looks at the package, if it always took the best route, not only if it arrived at the best port. this way far less packets get resend, which reduces the traffic on the network.",
        "answer_feedback": "the purpose is not limited to multicast but also used in broadcast. in rpf, a node decides whether the packet used the best route so far based on its routing table consisting of unicast information, not from the spanning tree. in rpb, is only forward packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree, which is not clear from the explanation.",

        "provided_answer": "the functionality of options in ipv4 headers is removed and replaced from the main header through a set of so-called extension headers. they are additional headers in the ipv6 which are used for implementing more extensions. the main header has a fixed size of 40 bytes; the extensions headers, on the other hand, are optional and are added as needed. that means you can add extensions without planning it. there are several extension headers: routing, fragment, destination, etc. \n\nthe extension headers are placed between the fixed header and the payload. every extension header points to the next header. there is also the possibility to refer to a \"no next header\" which is only to show that nothing else follows. it creates a chain, at the end of which is usually the tcp or udp header.\n\n\nextension headers are a way to extend the header and put additional information between the payload and the header. they are optional, and that's why we have an absolute efficiency gain comparing to ipv4. because in ipv4, we had at least one part for the option reserved, but in ipv6, we can say there are no extension headers, and so we have a smaller header and, therefore, much more space for the payload. also, extension headers result in a significant improvement in router performance for packets containing options. in contrast to ipv4, the extension headers are only examined by a router when a packet arrives at its final destination and not along their delivery path.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the reverse forwarding each router has the information about which path it should use for unicast-packets.if the packet arriving at an is is not using the best route this packet will be handled as a duplicate therefore being discarded. otherwise if the packet is using the best route , it will be resend over all edges (without including the incoming one) reverse path broadcast: this one is very similar to the rpf but less robust. the biggest difference is that the packet will be resent to the selected  edge at which the packets arrived and then they will be rerouted to source s (it will not be resent to all edges)",

        "provided_answer": "the spanning tree is espescially interesting for broad and multicasting because it has the whole network without any loop, that reduces traffic, which is very important espescially for broad and multicasting because of the high network load. link state routing can be used to produce the spanning trees in that way, that you measure the distances of all the neighbours, which you then distribute to all other nodes. once every node has all the information about all the delays between them, they can all calculate the optimale spanning trees for themselfs.",

        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding: if a node receives a packet which it should forward further, it determines, if the packet sender is in the direction of the incoming packet. if yes, the packet is on the best route and is sent via all other edges except the incoming. otherwise, it's ignored, because it's moste likely a duplicate. reverse path broadcast behaves similar in selecting if the packet should be forwarded. but, instead of sending it to all other nodes, it does not forward the packets to another node, if it knows that it is not on the best route for this given source and destination.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding is that the intermediate systems (is) do not need to know the spanning trees. instead, each sender has its own spanning tree. when a packet arrives at an is it checks whether this packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this sender are usually also sent, meaning that no other packet from the same sender arriving at the is has used a better route so far. if this is the case, the incoming packet is forwarded over all edges except from the incoming one. if not, the packet gets discarded since it is not using the best route and most likely is a duplicate. the purpose of reverse path broadcast is to prevent the resending over all edges as it is the case with reverse path forwarding and instead only forward the packets over suitable edges. when a packet arrives at an is, it also checks whether the packet used the best route until now like above. the difference is that in this case only the edge, at which the packets which are rerouted to the sender, arrive, is selected for forwarding the incoming packet. key point is that path information gained by inspecting unicast packets is leveraged at each is to prevent unnecessary transmissions.",

        "provided_answer": "in frame bursting, instead of the sender sending one packet at a time, it sends ten packets at once. the sender waits for the packets until it has ten packets ready to send. put them together and just then send them.\n\nadvantage: better performance than carrier extension, since more data is sent at a time.\n\ndisadvantage: if there are only one or two packets to send, the sender will be waiting for the remain, to reach the 10 packets. if there are not 10 packets, after a timeout, the sender adds rubbish to the frame (so it has the needed size). so, the packets will be sent with a delay and with unnecessary data.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing.  in reverse path forwarding, each is has its own spanning tree instead of a global unified spanning tree and does not need to know other spanning trees. each is has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. now if a packet arrives at the is entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, this means: the packet used the best route until now and thus resend over all edges (not including the incoming one). if not, this means the packet did not use this route (it is not the best route) and thus discard the packet as it is most likely a duplicate. the problem with reverse path forwarding is that the packet is sent through all edges except for the sender. this is solved by reverse path broadcast. here, each node learns from the unicast packets. only if the is is located on the unicast between the broadcast sender s and a neighbor node b, then it will forward the packet.",
        "answer_feedback": "the response is partially correct as in rpf, the sender alone needs to be aware of the spanning tree, and an intermediate system only needs to be aware of which path it would use for (unicast)-packets (known through the unicast routing algorithms). the explanation of rpb is correct. the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is not limited to multicasting but also broadcasting.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast are variations of broadcast routing algorithms.  rpf can work using uni-cast and multi-cast. when a broadcasted message arrives at a node, the node keeps track of where the message arrived from first, and ignores the messages that arrive later. next, the node broadcasts the packet in all directions except the path it came from. this way, the shorted track between the source and node are tracked.  rpb works by forwarding packets only on the best unicast path. the best path is known by keeping track of the path used to broadcast packets between nodes.",

        "provided_answer": "routing in mobile networks is different than to fixed networks. it depends on many factors such as a faster changing network topology (faster moving nodes), distance when sending depends on the environment, the strength of the signal, the frequency, etc. security issue plays a crucial role in mobile than in fixed settings.  two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. hidden terminals:  we consider this relationship: a-b-c. a and b are sending, and each of them has a certain distance where they can communicate. a-b has a certain radius so b can listen to a. if c is sending something, b can listen to c. if a wants to send something and does the csma (carrier sense multiple access), it then listens to whatever it is on the channel, even if c is sending, a will not be able to hear it. therefore if a sends something to b, and at the same time, c sends something to b, there will be interference. that means if b is sending something, a and c listen to it. if a and c send something, the other side doesn't get this information. still, b receives the information. a sends to b, c cannot receive it, c sends something to b, a collision occurs at b. a is hidden for c, and c is hidden for a. \n\t exposed terminals: we consider this relationship: a-b-c-d. exposed terminals are an underutilization of the channel. b wants to send to a and has a specific area where something can be seen (area includes nodes: a, b, and c). at the same time, c wants to send something to d. this could work because d will not get the data from b, and a will not get the data from c. at the same time, at the same channel, and the same frequency b can send something to a and c can send something to d, this is possible, but in the middle, some other nodes may have waste around. therefore c has to wait. if we don't do anything, we would tell everybody to wait. if a is out of the scope of d, then we can send something. → this is described as underutilization. therefore, additional protocol and agreement between c and b should be done. if b is sending to a and then c starts sending a request to send to d, then they have to know that d is not being within the distance of a. they have to know that one node cannot see the other one at the same time. therefore csma/cd doesn't fit at this point.",

        "reference_answer": "slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): \nin the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. this results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each round trip time (rtt). this is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. when cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1. \n\ncongestion avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: \nin the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. there are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. this is done until a packet is lost. typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. \nafter a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. then cwnd is reset to 1.",

        "reference_answer": "purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).",
        "provided_answer": "reverse path forwarding : it is for broadcasting, it is for fowarding and transmission packets in multicast routing without getting false ip addresses. it is a variation of the spanning tree, where every sender node has its own spanning tree and path. the intermediate systems in between don't need to know those. if the packets arrive at an is, the packet used the best route available at that time. this is done by a resend over all edges, but not for the incoming one. if no packet arrived at the is, the packet didn't use that route being not the best route. this is done by dismissing packets. reverse path broadcast : it is for broadcasting. it is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. it works like reverse path forwarding but with a specific selection of the outgoing links. the \"rpf\" has the disadvantage of resending over all edges. it would be better to forward packets over suitable edges. so if a packet arrived at the is over which the packets for this station are usually sent before and the packet has used the best route until now, the suitable edges are selected at which the packets arrived. from those packets they are rerouted and resent to the source c. otherwise the packets are not send over all edges. if no packet arrived, discard the packets.",

        "provided_answer": "I would recommend CSMA p-persistent because it would the most efficient for large amounts of transmissions while also preventing collisions. It is more efficient than non-persistent (for example) due to the way it checks the channel for activity, rather than waiting a random amount of time to check back, the p-persistent procedure checks back continuously and then based on some probability p, starts transmitting. Although it only checks for collision after transmission, it has a much lower rate of transmitting when others are also transmitting due to the random nature at which begins its transmission. This prevents all 20 systems from immediately transmitting at once as soon as the channel is free. Despite the obvious downside that it does not check for collisions during transmission, I find this to be an efficient procedure for sharing channels.",

Over time, the complete table will be built up. - How is the table used in the forwarding process?

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges:\ni)Hidden Terminal: Nodes\u2019 transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur.\niii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",
        "provided_answer": "Routing in mobile networks is different than to fixed networks. It depends on many factors such as a faster changing network topology (faster moving nodes), distance when sending depends on the environment, the strength of the signal, the frequency, etc. Security issue plays a crucial role in mobile than in fixed settings.  Two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. HIDDEN TERMINALS:  We consider this relationship: A-B-C. A and B are sending, and each of them has a certain distance where they can communicate. A-B has a certain radius so B can listen to A. If C is sending something, B can listen to C. If A wants to send something and does the CSMA (carrier sense multiple access), it then listens to whatever it is on the channel, even if C is sending, A will not be able to hear it. Therefore if A sends something to B, and at the same time, C sends something to B, there will be interference. That means if B is sending something, A and C listen to it. If A and C send something, the other side doesn't get this information. Still, B receives the information. A sends to B, C cannot receive it, C sends something to B, a collision occurs at B. A is hidden for C, and C is hidden for A. \n\t EXPOSED TERMINALS: We consider this relationship: A-B-C-D. Exposed terminals are an underutilization of the channel. B wants to send to A and has a specific area where something can be seen (area includes nodes: A, B, and C). At the same time, C wants to send something to D. This could work because D will not get the data from B, and A will not get the data from C. At the same time, at the same channel, and the same frequency B can send something to A and C can send something to D, this is possible, but in the middle, some other nodes may have waste around. Therefore C has to wait. If we don't do anything, we would tell everybody to wait. If A is out of the scope of D, then we can send something. \u2192 this is described as underutilization. Therefore, additional protocol and agreement between C and B should be done. If B is sending to A and then C starts sending a request to send to D, then they have to know that D is not being within the distance of A. They have to know that one node cannot see the other one at the same time. Therefore CSMA/CD doesn't fit at this point.",

        "provided_answer": "Challenges in Mobile routing are different from fixed and wired networks because the topography in mobile networks is always changing. Hidden Terminals are formed when 2 nodes in a network are too far apart to be able to listen to eachother, but are both visible to other nodes in their range. This can lead to collisions at nodes that can hear both nodes. RTS/CTS is used to fix this problem. Exposed Terminals are a problem when there are many nodes in the network and RTS/CTS is in use. For example, given 4 nodes, A, B, C, D, B wants to communicate with A, and so B sends A an RTS, in response, A sends everyone in the channel a CTS. At the same time, C wants to send to D, but due to A's CTS, has to wait for the duration specified, even though D is outside A's network range, so the communication between A and B poses no threat to C and D's communication.",

If C sends to B, A cannot receive transmission from C. In case of a collision at node B, node C can't detect a collision. Using a CSMA/CA approach the problem for hidden terminals can be solved. -Exposed terminals : In case of four nodes A,B,C,D. If B sends to node A, the node C sends further to a next node D, while node C is set to wait, because it is in use.

        "provided_answer": "All senders/receivers have a defined range. If the range does not reach a station, they cannot communicate with each other. And if some stations both have one station in their range like a cellular tower that can receive data from only one device, their data transmission can interfere without the knowledge of each other. The intermediate station has to decide which data to forward. This challenge is called \"hidden terminal\", because A (or C) is hidden from C (or A). Another challenge is called the exposed Terminal. When one station has many other station in its range, but just wants to send data to one specific, the other stations in its range have to wait. During this time, the other stations will not send or receive any data, because they sense the medium (e.g. air) is already in use. For example: A and C are in range of B. B wants to send data to A and uses a wireless connection over air. C then receives the data as well, because it is not adressed to C, it will discard the messages. During this process, C cannot communicate with B or any other station that is in its range (also if B cannot see it).",

Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP)\n\t Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information  (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)",
        "provided_answer": "DHCP is a protocol to assign IP addresses to the devices in a network dynamically. The addresses are a assigned by a DHCP Server very similar to RARP but only for a limited time. Clients have to renew their address before it expires.",

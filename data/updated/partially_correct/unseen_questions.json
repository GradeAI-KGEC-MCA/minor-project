        "reference_answer": "connectionless, because you will communicate with various partners (websites) for short periods of time. if you would initiate a connection with every website you skim, that would incur a lot of overhead in the connecting and disconnecting phase, just to have very short data transfers.",
        "provided_answer": "i would say the connection-oriented service is better, because i am browsing for very specific and important information. though i need the guarantee that my query responds consistent information, so that i do not lose important pages and the pages i receive should always be in the same order for the same query. if not i couldn't refine the query well.",
        "answer_feedback": "since it is an iterative process with many iterations searching for specific information, we need to put many inquiries through the network. so it makes sense to use connectionless. just in the case of losing the specific information, one can reframe the query and submit it again.",

        "provided_answer": "software-defined networking allows to easily modify the network control logic. it also drastically reduces the switch complexity. \n\ntwo drawbacks of sdn are that the implementation of the controller is hard and that you have to update the whole network infrastructure if you want to switch from traditional routing to sdn.",
        "answer_feedback": "the response does not explain why the implementation of the controller is hard. additionally, hybrid networks are also possible so that one does not have to switch the entire network's infrastructure.",

        "provided_answer": "the control plane is a central point for decision making for the whole network. physically it can be distributed on multiple machines. it is separated from the data plane to simplify the decision making processes. it has a global view of the network which improves performance of the control plane.\nthe data plane is distributed on different devices in the network. its main purpose is the forwarding of the packets. it only has a small view compared to the control plane. is often implemented by using routers/switches and performance can be increased by utilising hardware for the forwarding (e.g. managed switch).",

Is it better to use a connection-oriented or connectionless service for your communication in this scenario? Explain your answer in 1-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Connectionless, because you will communicate with various partners (websites) for short periods of time. If you would initiate a connection with every website you skim, that would incur a lot of overhead in the connecting and disconnecting phase, just to have very short data transfers.",
        "provided_answer": "A connection-oriented service is better for this scenario as the information is very important and thus the data should be reliable.\nThus, as there is no time restriction the connection oriented may take longer but the information will be reliable.",

        "provided_answer": "Since I am looking for a very specific important piece of information, it should be guaranteed that the information I receive at the end is correct. A connection-oriented service is a more reliable connection service because it guarantees data packets transfer from one end to the other end with a connection. Furthermore, it is also beneficial for our multiple searches, because there is no congestion as it provides an end-to-end connection between sender and receiver during transmission of data.",

Especially when searching for something specific from something as large as the web (and it is expected to take a long time), the initial cost of the connection is insignificant. One could also argue for the use of a connectionless service, however, I think the process of refining the search query based on the top search results is indicative of the need for a connection-oriented service.",

        "provided_answer": "In my opinion, you could argue for both services, it depends on how you understand the task. \nThe argument in favor of a connection-oriented service is that it provides a better service, but at the expense of the state. When the handshake is done, I can be sure that the connection is established. Since the information is very important and specific, it could be that it is important that the packets arrive exactly in the order in which they were sent. The disadvantage is that there is no connection if the network is overloaded. \nThe advantage of a connectionless service is that there is a communication even if the network is overloaded (but then maybe stalled). Since I have an important piece of information, it can be better in this case that I get the information at all (even if delayed), than not at all. However, the disadvantage is that I cannot be sure that the recipient is ready to receive my request and that the packets are not received in the same order as they were sent or even can get lost. \n\nAll in all, I would therefore suggest a combination of both to use the advantages and compensate the disadvanteges as mentioned on Slide 19 from \"Introduction Basics - Concepts\" and as Google is doing it by using TCP and UDP. If only one has to be selected, I prefer a connection-oriented service, because the information is important and I definitely need it, i.e. as soon as the handshake is done, I can be sure that the connection is established. Also, since it is very specific information, it is important that all data packets arrive and in the correct order as it was sent off. Thus, the connection-oriented service offers a higher reliability, which is preferable for an important and specific information.",

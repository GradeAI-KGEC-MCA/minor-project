Compared to a token ring technology, CSMA is comperativeley cheap and easy scalable. A disadvantage may be the lower throughput caused by possible collisons compared to token ring, but for this CSMA provides better (lower) latency. With the collision detection the bandwith usage can be increased by quick collison recognition.

It is more efficient than non-persistent (for example) due to the way it checks the channel for activity, rather than waiting a random amount of time to check back, the p-persistent procedure checks back continuously and then based on some probability p, starts transmitting. Although it only checks for collision after transmission, it has a much lower rate of transmitting when others are also transmitting due to the random nature at which begins its transmission.

        "provided_answer": "In my opinion, Token Ring or CSMA/CD are appropriate choices. Depending on which requirements are more important, it's a tradeoff between cost, throughput and adding new users.  \nUltimately, for the present case, I would choose the non-persistent CSMA/CD. Non-persistent because it improves overall throughput (efficiency). \nCSMA/CD has lower costs compared to Token Ring (cost efficient), which is important to the company as funding is tight. Also, with CSMA/CD it is easier to add new users/stations (connect stations without shutting down the network). (I think, one could also choose p-persistent CSMA with small p, since the performances of p-persistent with small p and non-persistent are very similar at high load (slide 29) and p-persistent is a compromise between delay and throughput.)\nHowever, the disadvantage of CSMA/CD is that the number of collisions increases as the utilization increases, and there is poor throughput during high utilization periods. One disadvantage of non-persistent is that there are longer delays for single stations. For me, the cost and the simplicity of adding a new user were the main factors in favor of CSMA/CD, since Token Ring is much more expensive and it is more complex to add a new user.",

This way, the expansion would be easier.\nOn the downside, CSMA results into many collisions, since two or more channels may want to send data the same time. For this reason, we choose non-persistent CSMA with Collision Detection, because firstly, non-persistent CSMA works better with LANs with high transmission load (by waiting for random times) and secondly, CD will save some time from sending an already destroyed frame. The problem of the collisions will still exist, but it will not be so huge (instead of other CSMA methods).",

What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-\u03c1)\u03c1^n)/(1-\u03c1^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s.

For example, if we assume that the traffic goes through the CF path, this means that this path is heavily loaded and has high delays. Since the waiting time for the calculation of the shortest path is included in the weighting, connection EI now appears more attractive. New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad. A consequence of this is that the routing tables fluctuate strongly and this leads to erratic routing (instability), which is a big problem for the receiving side (packet loss/wrong packet order/additional overhead).",

Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.",
        "provided_answer": "If we define the metric as given the paths between the subnets C<->F and E<->I are highly utitlized as they transfer the traffic between the subnets. The packet may be routed on paths that do never lead to the other subnet (FGHIJ), thrown away after TTL hops and therefore never be received at G.",
        "answer_feedback": "The links C-F and E-I are highly used, you're right. But if a packet wants to go from ABCDE to FGHIJ, C-F and E-I will be compared and the packet will go on the link, with less utilization of those two and not on the links that are at least used overall.",

        "provided_answer": "There are multiple ways how to detect duplicate packets on the transport layer in a connection-oriented service.\nOne method is using only temporarily valid TSAPs, which are only valid for one connection.By using this method, neither the endsystem (ES) nor the sender has to\u00a0 store additional information over a \"long\" timeBit since this results in long length port numbers/ TSAPs, with this method results in a higher bandwidth. Additionally,\u00a0 \"well known\" TSAPs are present, making this method not suitable.\nAnother method is to identify each connection by assigning a sequence number (SeqNo) to each connection individually, while the ES remembers already assigned SeqNo.This allows the use of \"well known\" TSAPs while allowing detection of delayed duplicate packets. Compared to the text method, this way you have a lower bandwidth need in exchange for a higher memory need, since\u00a0the ES needs store this information, but this information needs to be available, whenever needed. Additionally, this method does not support connections-less systems.\nThe last method is that each Physical Data Unit (PDU) has an individual SeqNo.This way, ES do not need to store additional information for a longer time and \"well known\" TSAPs can be used.Furthermore, the SeqNo for PDUs would last for a long time, even assuming they aren't reset. This can further improved by limiting reissuing SeqNos and limiting the packet lifetime.However, this results in an higher usage of bandwidth and memory.",

        "provided_answer": "Temporary TSAPs:\nThe advantage is that duplicate packets can do no harm since they do not find a transport process and additional information does not have to be stored for a \"long\" time. On the other hand one disadvantage is that it is harder to connect with a process since new trasnport adresses have to be generated each time. In addition to that well-known TSAPs are present which makes this method not suitable.\n\nIdentify connections individually:\nThe advantage is that when a connection request comes the request can be checked against the conncections which were established before. In comparison to the next method this method has a higher need for memory and the bandwidth is less limited. The biggest diasdvantage is that both sender and receiver have to store this information indefinately. In case of a crash and the identifiers are lost the endsystem will no longer know which identifiers have been used.\n\nIdentify PDUs individually:\nOne advantage is that the squence numbers last for a long time e.g. 8000 years with 48 bit as 1000 msg/sec. The disadvantage is that a higher usage of memory and bandwidth is needed.",

A major disadvantage is that large names need to be used for each TSAP, since they are required to be unique.\u00a0\n2) Identifying connections individually - This helps to avoid duplicates because different connections dont interact with each other, and the established connections must keep track of their transactions, hence, duplicates can be avoided from being re-transacted. A major disadvantage is that a framework is required to keep track of connections as well as transactions.\u00a0\n3) Identifying PDUs individually - By keeping track of individual packets, and assigning them a sequence number, duplicate packets can be identified and ignored.

        "provided_answer": "Usage of temporarily valid TSAPs: This method addresses duplicate packages by switching TSAPs (e.g. ports) regularly and thus rejects duplicate packages that reach an outdated TSAP. This approach has the advantage that it handles duplicates very lightweight as the actual transport protocol does not need to care about duplicates when those are handled through binding the service to TSAPs. A disadvantage is that some services are per convention reached on a well-known TSAP (like e.g. a webserver at TCP port 80), where changing TSAPs would complicate finding the correct TSAP to connect to.Individual identification of connections: This method addresses duplicates by assigning each connection a SeqNo meaning a unique identifier that is remembered by the participating endsystems. This has the advantage that services can still be assigned to any well-known TSAP without conflict and this method solves receiving duplicate packages from a connection that has already been closed. A disadvantage is that the endsystems need to remember all previously assigned sequence numbers and those also need to be readily available, which would not be the case when e.g. the system is offline.Individual identification of PDUs: This method addresses duplicates be assigning each single PDU in all connections a unique SeqNo. This has the advantage that it definitely allows for uniquely identifying a package and immediately seeing whether we have seen this exact package before (and e.g. not just a equal package within the same connection). The disadvantage is that we have an increased overhead for duplicate detection as we have to maintain the numbering for each package.",

In theory this would solve our problem but in practical real-world scenarios this is not possible because we have designated well-known TSAPs that do not change (e.g. HTTP -> port 80)\n\n2. to identify connections individuallyThis method wants to get rid of duplicates between connections. In this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. Again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports. One disadvantage of this is though that the endsystems have to remember the already assigned sequence numbers. So the endsystems have to store more information. Also another issue to mention is that this works only for connection oriented systems, this won't work with connection-less systems.\u00a0\n\n3. to identify PDUs individually: individual sequential numbers for each PDUTo go even one step further we could identify the individual packets. So each packet get a unique sequence number. This is a very good way of avoiding duplicates.

        "provided_answer": "We have three service classes in the data link layer. So there are: \n-Unconfirmed, connectionless Service: The transmitter just sends packages and acknowledges the possibility that data is lost on the communication way. There is no acknowledgement of receiving data, as well as no flow control. Therefore, this kind of service does not need any kind of connect or disconnect phase. \n-Confirmed, connectionless Service: Each packet requires an acknowledgement signal sent form the receiver to the transmitter afterwards. If this signal is received at transmitter or if it comes too late (after a certain time frame), the same package is sent again to the receiver. Now, we have the possibility of duplicates and sequence errors due to retransmit.\n-Connection-Oriented service: To avoid all kind of loss- duplicate or sequencing-error , this service needs 3-phased communication to establish a state-oriented virtual \u201ccircuit switching\u201d: At the beginning, we have a connection initialization, then a process of sending and acknowledging packages followed by a distinct disconnection process. \n\nAll in all it can be summarized, that all three services are different in the amount of of care that is spent for error protection and signal acknowledgment. Therefore, the different services are used in different cases: Unconfired, connectionless Services are only used when we can rely on avery robust and stable connection (for example LANs), while confirmed, connectionless and connection-oriented services are used in less reliable networks, for example mobile communication.",

        "provided_answer": "The three services are called Unconfirmed Connectionless Service, Confirmed Connectionless Service and Connection-Oriented Service. These differ in their characteristics and areas of application. The first two services differ in whether or not the receiver acknowledges a packet when it receives it. The Unconfirmed Connectionless service does not include confirmation and assumes that the sent packets have arrived correctly. By confirming in the Confirmed Connectionless  service, this service can ensure that all packets have arrived at the receiver. Lost packets cannot be confirmed and so the recipient sends the packet again after a specified timeout. Both mentioned services have no flow control and no explicit requests to establish or disconnect a connection. The Confirmed Connectionless service has an implicit confirmation if a connection can be established, exactly when its packets are confirmed by the receiver. The confirmation of the second service class can cause duplicates to appear at the receiver, when the confirmation of a packet does not arrive at the sender. The third service class executes a three-phase communication and tries to establish a connection first. If the connection is confirmed, packets are sent until a request for disconnection is sent and confirmed. If the communication takes place over an error-free channel, no losses, no duplicates and no sequence errors are to be expected. Flow control is guaranteed by the \"handshake\". The first service type is usually used for the transition of isolated single units in channels with very low error rate (e.g. LANs, voice communication). The second service type can be used for channels with a high error rate such as mobile communication. The last service type is preferred for long and persistent communication.",

        "provided_answer": "As TCP is much more complex in comparison to UDP, it also shows a much more complicated header with more and detailed information about the package and its routing. For example, there are the following four differences between the headers of the two protocols: \n- First of all, TCP includes a sequence number for sending to ensure that all packages can be organized by the receiver in the same order as they were sent. UDP does not give any information about the right sequence of packages, so there is no guarantee for the order that the receiver gets or can create.\n- Furthermore, TCP gives reliability to the users by also including a field for acknowledgements in the header. To be more precise, the included sequence number works as an acknowledgement for a package receiver earlier. On the other hand, UDP does not give any guarantee concerning reliability of service, so there is no space in the header for any kind of acknowledgement. \n- What is more, TCP includes possibilities for flow and congestion control by dynamically adjusting the window size for sending and receiving packets at the same time. This process makes use of the \u201cAdvertised window\u201d field in the header which can be used by a receiver to transmit its optimal window size for reception of packets. UDP on the other hand does not include such features, so there is no space for windowing in the header. \n- Finally, TCP also gives the user possibilities to prioritize packages for urgent processing at the receiver process. Therefore, the header includes the so called 16-bit \u201cUrgent Pointer\u201d which is an offset to the sequence number and marks the last octet of a sequence of highly prioritized packets. UDP does not have any included features for marking urgent data, so there is also no mechanism like the urgent pointer in the UDP header.",

The additional bytes of the TCP header length are for the Sequence Number, Acknowledge Number, HL/RESV/Flags, Advertised Win, Urgent Pointer and the options. This additional information cannot be found in the UDP header, in particular there is no possibility for options besides the compulsory function of the header.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",
        "provided_answer": "No, because traffic can be dependent on the time or previous arrivals. For video streaming, arrivals are more likely to occur during the evening than during the morning, and are also dependent on previous arrivals (it\u2019s likely for streaming that an arrival follows another arrivals, meaning the user continues to stream).",
        "answer_feedback": "One can use a function instead of a constant to model the arrival rate to reflect such large-scale behavioral patterns like having more traffic in the evening.

        "provided_answer": "An important characteristic of the Poisson distribution is that the probability of x taking a discrete value is independent upon the previous values i.e. the probability is independent of the past. Poisson distribution is often used to model arrival of packets during an interval. The packet arrival times modeled by the Poisson distribution have an exponential distribution and constitute an independent identically distributed process. However, in practice it has been shown that the packet inter-arrival times do not have an exponential distribution, hence the error introduced by modeling them as Poisson distribution is significantly large.",

        "provided_answer": "Routing in mobile networks is different than to fixed networks. It depends on many factors such as a faster changing network topology (faster moving nodes), distance when sending depends on the environment, the strength of the signal, the frequency, etc. Security issue plays a crucial role in mobile than in fixed settings.  Two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. HIDDEN TERMINALS:  We consider this relationship: A-B-C. A and B are sending, and each of them has a certain distance where they can communicate. A-B has a certain radius so B can listen to A. If C is sending something, B can listen to C. If A wants to send something and does the CSMA (carrier sense multiple access), it then listens to whatever it is on the channel, even if C is sending, A will not be able to hear it. Therefore if A sends something to B, and at the same time, C sends something to B, there will be interference. That means if B is sending something, A and C listen to it. If A and C send something, the other side doesn't get this information. Still, B receives the information. A sends to B, C cannot receive it, C sends something to B, a collision occurs at B. A is hidden for C, and C is hidden for A. \n\t EXPOSED TERMINALS: We consider this relationship: A-B-C-D. Exposed terminals are an underutilization of the channel. B wants to send to A and has a specific area where something can be seen (area includes nodes: A, B, and C). At the same time, C wants to send something to D. This could work because D will not get the data from B, and A will not get the data from C. At the same time, at the same channel, and the same frequency B can send something to A and C can send something to D, this is possible, but in the middle, some other nodes may have waste around. Therefore C has to wait. If we don't do anything, we would tell everybody to wait. If A is out of the scope of D, then we can send something. \u2192 this is described as underutilization. Therefore, additional protocol and agreement between C and B should be done. If B is sending to A and then C starts sending a request to send to D, then they have to know that D is not being within the distance of A. They have to know that one node cannot see the other one at the same time. Therefore CSMA/CD doesn't fit at this point.",
        "answer_feedback": "The response correctly describes the hidden terminal challenge. In the second exposed terminal challenge, C has to wait because it detects the channel to be busy as B is sending and not because \"there are nodes in between which have waste around\".",

        "provided_answer": "Challenges in Mobile routing are different from fixed and wired networks because the topography in mobile networks is always changing. Hidden Terminals are formed when 2 nodes in a network are too far apart to be able to listen to eachother, but are both visible to other nodes in their range. This can lead to collisions at nodes that can hear both nodes. RTS/CTS is used to fix this problem. Exposed Terminals are a problem when there are many nodes in the network and RTS/CTS is in use. For example, given 4 nodes, A, B, C, D, B wants to communicate with A, and so B sends A an RTS, in response, A sends everyone in the channel a CTS. At the same time, C wants to send to D, but due to A's CTS, has to wait for the duration specified, even though D is outside A's network range, so the communication between A and B poses no threat to C and D's communication.",

        "provided_answer": "1. Hidden Terminals: In mobile routing we communicate wireless. Consider the setup from slide 11: A to B, C to B. In here, node A can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node C. Node C can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node A. The hidden terminal problem occurs when node A and node B want to send data to node B at the same time. This results in collsions and waste of resources. The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C. As a consequence, node C knows that nothing can be sent to B for a certain amount of time. If node C wants to send something to B, C needs to reserve the channel too by a RTS. 2. Near and Far Terminals: - Consider the setup from slide 18: We have three nodes A, B and C. B and C are relatively close to each other while A has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. The problem of near and far terminals occurs when A and B want to send something to C at the same time. Due to the fact that the signal strength decreases the larger the distance is, the signal of B drowns out the weaker signal of A. As a consequence, C cannot receive anything from A.",

        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals: In mobile communication, one challenge is, that several nodes cant hear each other. Therefore if two Nodes that can't hear each other communicate with a third node both can reach a collision at this third node can occur. Further, the first two nodes cannot sense the collision and thus the communication is very unreliable, in addition to the waste of resources that always comes with collisions. This problem can be avoided if the third Node sends a \"busy tone\" to the first two nodes if it receives data by one of those nodes and therefore the other one keeps silent. However, a separate channel for the busy tones is needed. Exposed Terminals: Example with the four Terminals: A B C D. Each terminal reaches only its neighbours. If B sends data to A and C wants to send data to D, C can sense the transmission of B and A and therefore has to wait, even though A is outside the range of C and therefore a collision would not occur.

During this time, the other stations will not send or receive any data, because they sense the medium (e.g. air) is already in use. For example: A and C are in range of B. B wants to send data to A and uses a wireless connection over air. C then receives the data as well, because it is not adressed to C, it will discard the messages.

        "provided_answer": "Two challenges in Mobile Routing are Hidden Terminals and Exposed Terminals. With Hidden Terminals, the challenge occurs when two nodes that are not in range of each other both try to communicate with another node that they are both in reach with. For example node A and C are not in range of each other but can both communicate with node B. Now when node A sends something to B, then C cannot receive this transmission. Because of that C will think that B is free for transmission and might also send data to B. This simultaneous transmission will result in a collision and a loss of data from both A and C. With Exposed Terminals we imagine the example from above with another node D that is only in range of C. Now if B is sending data to A and C wants to send data to D. C will then see that the carrier is busy and has to wait until it detects it to be idle. But since A is not within the interference range of C waiting is not needed and results in under-utilization of resources.",

        "provided_answer": "Hidden Terminals: Because of the transmission range is limited, there can be the situation that there a two stations A and C which cannot reach each other. And due to that A cannot recognize if C is transmitting over the shared medium, so collisions can occur. So A is hidden for C and the other way round. If there is a node B in between which can communicate with both of them, this node can detect these collisions. CSMA/CD does not work in this case. Near and Far Terminals: Due to the transmission within a wireless environment, there is a decreasing signal strength on the transmissions path through the medium.

        "provided_answer": "There are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. Two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * Hidden Terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. As an example, we can imagine that station A and C does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station B in the middle. So A and C both try to transmit data to C, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * Exposed Terminals: A problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. We can easily imagine a situation, where the stations B and C are in close proximity to each other, but where C cannot see B\u2019s partner A and B cannot detect C\u2019s partner D.  If B wants to send data to A, which is not visible to C, C has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner D is also blocked by B\u2019s communication. In reality, C could send parallel to B, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. So we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * Inherent Heterogenity: As mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. Therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * Dynamic Source Routing: Due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in \u201cnormal\u201d networks. So one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based Dynamic Source Routing in reactive routing protocols.",

Reverse Path Forwarding / Reverse Path Flooding: The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. Therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. The spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. There can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: Is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to S? - If it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - Otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. Reverse Path Broadcast The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. It basically works as Reverse Path Forwarding with one difference: When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. A node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",

If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to \"ask itself\" two questions. First \"has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will \"ask itself\" the next question. \"Have the packets used the BEST route until now?\" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

        "provided_answer": "REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing. Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The principle of RPF is each sender has its own Spanning Tree but IS does not need to know the Spanning Trees. Each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Algorithm of RPF is as below: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. TRPB routing is an extension of RPB routing. It ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. The principle of RPB is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. A router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. The Algorithm of RPB is as below: Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent?  YES: Packet used the BEST route until now?   YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction)  NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)  NO: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",

        "provided_answer": "- REVERSE PATH FORWARDING: The main idea is here is that each sender has its own Spanning tree, but the IS do not need to know the spanning trees itself. _Algorithm:_ 1. node B sends unicast packets to destination node S using the shortest route via the node A 2. Node S sends braodcast packets to all nodes which are also forwared by A to B 3. Since B also can get the braodcasted packets from other nodes, the unicast routing information is used to determine which information to keep: - if the broadcastet packet from S did not arrive via A, ignore it because we know that the path via A is the shortest route - if the broadcastet packets arrived via A then keep the data because we know its the shortest route - REVERSE PATH BROADCAST:  The main idea here is to just use the edges, in the broadcast step, at which the packets arrived and reroute it to the source instead of broadcasting to all and every nodes. This helps avoiding duplicates. _Algorithm:_ 1. Node B sends unicast packets to Node S via node A. Where A inspects the packets and can learn the best path and also the best path in the reversed direction. Furthermore, other connected nodes to B can learn that they never did receive a unicast path from B to S, means they are not part of the path.  2. Now when S broadcasts the packets, just A fowards the packets to B. The other connected Node to B will not forward the packets to B because it knows it is not part of the best route \u2192 the connection from that node to B is relieved.

        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding and Broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. They enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. If this is the case, no forwarding takes place to AVOID LOOPS. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (also called Reverse Path Flooding) (RPF) is a variation of the method spanning tree. Each sender has its spanning tree. The other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. The assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  The RPF algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. If yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. If not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. This duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. The significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. If a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. As soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. The disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. The REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is like RPF but with a specific selection of outgoing links. After the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. If yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S. If not, it won't send over all edges. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",

The best route in this case, is the one you would normally use in a unicast transmission.  If the incoming package has NOT taken the best route, it is discarded as it is most likely a copy.   If it HAS taken the best route the router forwards the package.

        "provided_answer": "Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and  Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) are techniques used for Multi- and Broadcast communication. Their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each IS can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   In Reverse Path Forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. If a unicast packet from A to C passes a router B frequently, B knows that it is on the shortest path from A to C and reverse. If, on the other hand, a router D never sees any unicast packets from A to C, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. This information is then used when a flooding packet from A or C (sender) arrives at either C or D (IS). Only if the IS is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   Reverse Path Broadcasting is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. Not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the IS entry port, where it received the multicast packets like RPF does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. In contrast to RPF, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, RPB attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. Namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.",

Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

By forwarding unicast packets an IS e.g. M learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node S and D).

If a packet arrives at one intermediate node, it first checks if the packat arrived via the path over which nodes to the sending source are usually sent. Only of this is the case, the packet is further processed. In RPF the incoming packet is simply distributed to all outgoing edges (excluding the incoming edge).

It is a variation of the spanning tree, where every sender node has its own spanning tree and path. The intermediate systems in between don't need to know those. If the packets arrive at an IS, the packet used the best route available at that time. This is done by a resend over all edges, but not for the incoming one. If no packet arrived at the IS, the packet didn't use that route being not the best route. This is done by dismissing packets. Reverse Path Broadcast : It is for broadcasting. It is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. It works like reverse path forwarding but with a specific selection of the outgoing links. The \"RPF\" has the disadvantage of resending over all edges. It would be better to forward packets over suitable edges. So if a packet arrived at the IS over which the packets for this station are usually sent before and the packet has used the best route until now, the suitable edges are selected at which the packets arrived.

        "provided_answer": "In Broad/Multicast the goal is to reach the whole network or a group to share the resources as efficient as possible. For Broadcast, a simple algorithm like Flooding can be used. The algorithm is very robust, but there is lots of overhead because of the many potential duplicates in the network. With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group.  To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree. For Multicast, each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong, so there can be also determined a multicast path by every node. A multicast spanning tree is created.",

The DHCP may also provide additional configuration information, such as DNS server, netmask, default router, \u2026",

        "provided_answer": "In the Piggybacking Extension, outgoing acknowledgements are hooked onto the next outgoing packet. For this to work, you first need a duplex operation mode. In the normal sliding window concept, every incoming data unit is acknowledged as soon as the receiver gets it. For Piggybacking, the acknowledgement needs to be temporarily delayed, until the previous incoming data is processed and the Network Layer passes the next packet to be sent back. The delayed acknowledgement is now attached to the outgoing packet.",

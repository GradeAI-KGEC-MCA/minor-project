However, you are not quite sure how to find it and adopt an iterative process of refining your query after every search, depending on the shown results and a skim of the first few websites. Is it better to use a connection-oriented or connectionless service for your communication in this scenario? Explain your answer in 1-4 sentences.",
        "reference_answer": "Connectionless, because you will communicate with various partners (websites) for short periods of time. If you would initiate a connection with every website you skim, that would incur a lot of overhead in the connecting and disconnecting phase, just to have very short data transfers.",
        "provided_answer": "We want to consider, how our process will be changed, if a result to a query will not be shown to us, because of a connection error. Depending on our strategy, if the piece of information we search for not being shown to us will lead to us refining our query in a way, that we will not be shown the piece of information again, then we should use a connected-oriented service. Otherwise, if us refining the query will not lead to us always missing out on the piece of information we search for, a connectionless service will do as some results not being shown will hinder the iterative process too much.",

From the view of the search machine this transaction is now finished and other users can be served. \n\nWhen I then issue a new, refined query to the machine, the previously served requests do not matter for the result, as the search machine should not hold a state.

Connectionless service is used in the network system to transfer data from one end to another end without creating any connection. \n\nSo it does not require establishing a connection before sending the data from the sender to the receiver. It is not a reliable network service because it does not guarantee the transfer of data packets to the receiver, and data packets can be received in any order to the receiver. Therefore we can say that the data packet does not follow a defined path. \n\nA connectionless communication has an advantage over a connection-oriented communication, in that it has low overhead. It also allows for Browsing, multicast and broadcast operations in which the same data are transmitted to several recipients in a single transmission.",

        "provided_answer": "In my opinion, you could argue for both services, it depends on how you understand the task. \nThe argument in favor of a connection-oriented service is that it provides a better service, but at the expense of the state. When the handshake is done, I can be sure that the connection is established. Since the information is very important and specific, it could be that it is important that the packets arrive exactly in the order in which they were sent. The disadvantage is that there is no connection if the network is overloaded. \nThe advantage of a connectionless service is that there is a communication even if the network is overloaded (but then maybe stalled). Since I have an important piece of information, it can be better in this case that I get the information at all (even if delayed), than not at all. However, the disadvantage is that I cannot be sure that the recipient is ready to receive my request and that the packets are not received in the same order as they were sent or even can get lost. \n\nAll in all, I would therefore suggest a combination of both to use the advantages and compensate the disadvanteges as mentioned on Slide 19 from \"Introduction Basics - Concepts\" and as Google is doing it by using TCP and UDP. If only one has to be selected, I prefer a connection-oriented service, because the information is important and I definitely need it, i.e. as soon as the handshake is done, I can be sure that the connection is established. Also, since it is very specific information, it is important that all data packets arrive and in the correct order as it was sent off. Thus, the connection-oriented service offers a higher reliability, which is preferable for an important and specific information.",

This plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. \n- As it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don\u2019t have to include a complex control logic anymore. They get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don\u2019t have to figure them out by themselves. \n\nOf course, there are also disadvantages of Software Defined Networking: \n- Security protection is a major concern in SDN since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. So the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. \n- In order to establish SDN, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane.

Furthermore, there is a reduction in the complexity of the hardware due to the separation of the control logic from the data plane.

        "provided_answer": "Benefit 1: Software defined networking allows more flexibility, because a device's logic is not hardcoded in the hardware. Instead of designing and building a new piece of hardware, with SDN one can simply change the logic by using a high level programming language.\nBenefit 2: SDN allows us to source out the control logic of a switch, where performance is expensive, to a server where much more performance is available. This also reduces the complexity of the switch itself, because the logic is handled by the server.\nDrawback 1: The CAP problem occurs, meaning that with SDN we can only achieve two of the following attributes at a time: consistency, availability, partition tolerance. A prioritization has to be made for each network.\nDrawback 2: Because the controllers are now responsible for the control logic of the entire network, the controllers get very complex and, in case of a distributed network, even have to handle communication with each other.",

Each hardware component must be maintained, and connections must be monitored broadly. A SDN network allows all of these hardware components to be managed via a single touchpoint.\n\nDrawbacks:\nOne of the problems with virtualizing any infrastructure is the latency that arises as a result.

        "provided_answer": "One benefit of SDN is, that it reduces the switch complexity which means that the switches still have the same forwarding performance but the control logic is removed and host on servers instead.\nAnother benefit is, that SDN allows easy modifications of the network control logic. So by removing the \"hard-coded\" control logic from the switches this allows to modify it and get exchangeable software instead which can be adapted to the specific needs of the network.\nA drawback is the CAP problem which means, that for a distributed SDN controller only two out of three CAP properties (Consistency, Availability, Partitioning tolerance) are possible.\nA second drawback is, that the logically centralization makes the implementation of the control logic simpler but the implementation of the actual controller harder, because all the logic is delegated to the controller which has to become very smart to provide a consistent view of a logically centralized network. If it's distributed the controllers have to communicate with each other, have to agree on a global view so some of the overhead is delegated to the controller.",

        "provided_answer": "The control plane is a central point for decision making for the whole network. Physically it can be distributed on multiple machines. It is separated from the data plane to simplify the decision making processes. It has a global view of the network which improves performance of the control plane.\nThe data plane is distributed on different devices in the network. Its main purpose is the forwarding of the packets. It only has a small view compared to the control plane. Is often implemented by using Routers/Switches and performance can be increased by utilising hardware for the forwarding (e.g. managed switch).",

        "provided_answer": "A benefit of SDN is that the complexity of switches is reduced as the control logic is hosted in the control plane while switches still support forwarding in hardware which ensures the same performance as in traditional networks. \nAnother benefit is that the usage of high-level programming languages is possible in SDN, where traditional networking controllers/devices mostly have different and often low level programming languages through the presence of many different manufacturers.\n\nA drawback of SDN is that the logical centralization of the controller complicates its implementation as the controller ideally should support all CAP properties, i.e. consistency, availability, and partitioning tolerance.\n\nAnother drawback is the security.
